  Occasionally, patients may develop an intense local inflammatory response at the skin test site. Rarely, patients will develop a systemic allergic reaction, manifested by generalized erythema, pruritus, angioedema, urticaria, dyspnea, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. The usual methods of treating a skin test antigen-induced reaction - the applications of a venous occlusion tourniquet proximal to the skin test site and administration of epinephrine are recommended. The patient should be kept under observation for several hours.
