  As with the intravenous administration of other plasma-derived products, the following reactions may be observed following administration: headache, fever, chills, flushing, nausea, vomiting, tingling, lethargy, hives, stinging or burning at the infusion site or manifestations of allergic reactions. In a clinical study with Mononine  (r)  in previously untreated hemophilia B patients, five patients experienced ALT elevations. Serologic tests for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus were negative.



 The following adverse reactions have been spontaneously reported during post-marketing use of Mononine  (r)  as well as other Factor IX products: anaphylaxis, angioedema, cyanosis, dyspnea, hypotension, thrombosis, inadequate therapeutic response, and inhibitor development.



 There is a potential risk of thromboembolic episodes following the administration of Mononine  (r)  (see    WARNINGS    and    PRECAUTIONS    ).



 The patient should be monitored closely during the infusion of Mononine  (r)  to observe for the development of any reaction. If any reaction takes place that is thought to be related to the administration of Mononine  (r)  , the rate of infusion should be decreased or the infusion stopped, as dictated by the response of the patient.



 Should evidence of an acute hypersensitivity reaction be observed, the infusion should be stopped promptly and appropriate countermeasures and supportive therapy should be administered.
