  No phototoxicity and no photoallergenicity were detected in clinical studies with 24 and 33 normal volunteers, respectively. In human dermal safety studies, ELIDEL  (r)  (pimecrolimus) Cream 1% did not induce contact sensitization or cumulative irritation.



 In a one-year safety study in pediatric patients age 2-17 years old involving sequential use of ELIDEL Cream and a topical corticosteroid, 43% of ELIDEL patients and 68% of vehicle patients used corticosteroids during the study. Corticosteroids were used for more than 7 days by 34% of ELIDEL patients and 54% of vehicle patients. An increased incidence of impetigo, skin infection, superinfection (infected atopic dermatitis), rhinitis, and urticaria were found in the patients that had used ELIDEL Cream and topical corticosteroid sequentially as compared to ELIDEL Cream alone.



 In 3 randomized, double-blind vehicle-controlled pediatric studies and one active-controlled adult study, 843 and 328 patients respectively, were treated with ELIDEL Cream. In these clinical trials, 48 (4%) of the 1,171 ELIDEL patients and 13 (3%) of 408 vehicle-treated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events. Discontinuations for AEs were primarily due to application site reactions, and cutaneous infections. The most common application site reaction was application site burning, which occurred in 8%-26% of patients treated with ELIDEL Cream. 



 The following table depicts the incidence of adverse events pooled across the 2 identically designed 6-week studies with their open label extensions and the 1-year safety study for pediatric patients ages 2-17. Data from the adult active-controlled study is also included in this table. Adverse events are listed regardless of relationship to study drug.
