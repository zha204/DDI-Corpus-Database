  During clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse event in the BenzaClin treatment group was dry skin (12%). The Table below lists local adverse events reported by at least 1% of patients in the BenzaClin and vehicle groups.




   Local Adverse Events - all causalities    in &gt;/= 1% of patients     
  
                             BenzaClinn = 420      Vehiclen = 168       
  Application site reaction    13 (3%)               1 (&lt;1%)              
  Dry skin                   50 (12%)              10 (6%)              
  Pruritus                   8 (2%)                1 (&lt;1%)              
  Peeling                    9 (2%)                -                    
  Erythema                   6 (1%)                1 (&lt;1%)              
  Sunburn                    5 (1%)                -                    
         The actual incidence of dry skin might have been greater were it not for the use of a moisturizer in these studies.
 

 Hypersensitivity/allergic reactions (including facial swelling and urticaria) have been reported in post-marketing use with  BenzaClin Topical Gel  . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
