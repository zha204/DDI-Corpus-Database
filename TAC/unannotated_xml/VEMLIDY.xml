  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adverse Reactions in Adult Subjects with Chronic Hepatitis B and Compensated Liver Disease  



 The safety assessment of VEMLIDY was based on pooled data through the Week 48 data analysis from 1298 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials, Study 108 and Study 110, in adult subjects with chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease. A total of 866 subjects received VEMLIDY 25 mg once daily  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  .



 The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with VEMLIDY or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate due to adverse reactions of any severity was 1.0% and 1.2%, respectively. Table 1 displays the frequency of the adverse reaction (all Grades) greater than or equal to 5% in the VEMLIDY group.

             Renal Laboratory Tests  
 

 In a pooled analysis of Studies 108 and 110 in adult subjects with chronic hepatitis B and a median baseline eGFR of 106 and 105 mL per minute (for the VEMLIDY and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF] groups, respectively), mean serum creatinine increased by less than 0.1 mg/dL and median serum phosphorus decreased by 0.1 mg/ dL in both treatment groups. Median change from baseline in eGFR was -1.2 mL per minute in the VEMLIDY group and -5.4 mL per minute in those receiving TDF. The long-term clinical significance of these renal laboratory changes on adverse reaction frequencies between VEMLIDY and TDF is not known.



     Decrease in Bone Mineral Density  



 In a pooled analysis of Studies 108 and 110, the mean percentage change in bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to Week 48 as assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was -0.6% with VEMLIDY compared to -2.4% with TDF at the lumbar spine and -0.2% compared to -1.9% at the total hip. BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 6% of VEMLIDY subjects and 20% of TDF subjects. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 3% of VEMLIDY subjects and 6% of TDF subjects. The long-term clinical significance of these BMD changes is not known.



     Laboratory Abnormalities  



 The frequency of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving VEMLIDY in Studies 108 and 110 are presented in Table 2.

             Amylase and Lipase Elevations and Pancreatitis  
 

 In Studies 108 and 110, seven subjects treated with VEMLIDY with elevated amylase levels had associated symptoms, such as nausea, low back pain, abdominal tenderness, biliary pancreatitis and pancreatitis. Of these seven, two subjects discontinued VEMLIDY due to elevated amylase and/or lipase; one subject experienced recurrence of adverse events when VEMLIDY was restarted. No subject treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate had associated symptoms or discontinued treatment.

 Changes from baseline in total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol to HDL ratio among subjects treated with VEMLIDY and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are presented in Table 3.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS/SEVERE HEPATOMEGALY WITH STEATOSIS and POST TREATMENT SEVERE ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B

    WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS/SEVERE HEPATOMEGALY WITH STEATOSIS and POST TREATMENT SEVERE ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B  

    Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .   



   Discontinuation of anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VEMLIDY, may result in severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VEMLIDY. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .  



   EXCERPT:   WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS/SEVERE HEPATOMEGALY WITH STEATOSIS and POST TREATMENT SEVERE ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs. (5.1) 
 *  Discontinuation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may result in severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. Hepatic function should be monitored closely in patients who discontinue VEMLIDY. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. (5.2) 
</Section>
    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  HBV and HIV-1 coinfection: VEMLIDY alone is not recommended for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 resistance may develop in these patients. (  5.3  ) 
 *  New onset or worsening renal impairment: Assessment of serum creatinine, serum phosphorus, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein is recommended before initiating VEMLIDY therapy and during therapy as clinically appropriate. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis



  Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with VEMLIDY should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).



    5.2 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B after Discontinuation of Treatment



  Discontinuation of anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VEMLIDY, may result in severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. Patients who discontinue VEMLIDY should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.



    5.3 Risk of Development of HIV-1 Resistance in Patients Coinfected with HBV and HIV-1



  Due to the risk of development of HIV-1 resistance, VEMLIDY alone is not recommended for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The safety and efficacy of VEMLIDY have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. HIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV-infected patients before initiating therapy with VEMLIDY, and, if positive, an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen that is recommended for patients coinfected with HIV-1 should be used.



    5.4 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment



  Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir prodrugs in both animal toxicology studies and human trials. In clinical trials of VEMLIDY, there have been no cases of Fanconi syndrome or Proximal Renal Tubulopathy (PRT).



 Patients taking tenofovir prodrugs who have impaired renal function and those taking nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are at increased risk of developing renal-related adverse reactions [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .



 It is recommended that serum creatinine, serum phosphorous, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein be assessed before initiating VEMLIDY and during therapy in all patients as clinically appropriate. Discontinue VEMLIDY in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome.
