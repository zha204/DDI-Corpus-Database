  The serious adverse reaction observed during clinical trials with GLASSIA was exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This reaction occurred in one subject and was considered possibly related to treatment with GLASSIA due to its temporal association.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;0.5% of infusions) in clinical trials were headache and upper respiratory infection.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 A total of 65 subjects with severe Alpha1-PI deficiency (with pre-augmentation therapy serum Alpha1-PI levels less than 11 microM) have received treatment in two clinical trials. However, because of the large temporal difference between trials (&gt; 5 years) and major difference in study designs, each study was analyzed separately without excluding these three subjects who participated in both trials from either study analysis. Thus, safety and efficacy of GLASSIA are reported on all 18 subjects in the dose-escalation trial and all 50 subjects in the active-control trial, for a total of 68 subjects, representing 65 individual subjects.



 In the open label, non-parallel, dose-escalation trial, 18 subjects received a single infusion of GLASSIA at dosages of 30, 60 or 120 mg/kg.



 In the randomized, double-blind, active-control trial, 50 subjects were scheduled to receive weekly infusions of GLASSIA or the comparator Alpha1-PI product, Prolastin, at a dosage of 60 mg/kg for a total of 12 doses after which all subjects remaining in the trial were treated for another 12 weeks with GLASSIA only. Overall, 17 subjects received 12 doses and 32 subjects received 22 - 24 doses of GLASSIA during the trial. (One subject randomized to the comparator Alpha1-PI product did not receive any treatment with GLASSIA during the last 12 weeks of the trial.)



 The population treated with GLASSIA in these two trials was 40-74 years old, 54% male, 100% Caucasian and had congenital Alpha1-PI deficiency with clinical evidence of emphysema.



 Tables 1 and 2 compare the adverse reactions reported during the initial 12 weeks (double-blind portion) of the randomized, active comparator trial in all subjects treated with GLASSIA with reactions in the concurrent Prolastin control group. Table 3 compares the frequency of adverse reactions as a percentage of all infusions for GLASSIA and Prolastin-treated subjects over the entire trial period.



 Table 1: Number of Subjects/Infusions/Adverse ReactionsAn adverse reaction is any adverse event which met any of the following criteria: (a) an adverse event that began within 72 hours following the end of product infusion, or (b) an adverse event considered by either the investigator or sponsor to be at least possibly related to product administration, or (c) an adverse event for which causality assessment was missing or indeterminate.

         During the 12-week double blind portion of the randomized, active comparator trial, 4 subjects (12%) had a total of 7 exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during GLASSIA treatment and 5 subjects (29%) had a total of 6 exacerbations of COPD during Prolastin treatment. Seventeen additional exacerbations in 14 subjects (28%) occurred during the 12-week open-label treatment period with GLASSIA. The overall rate of pulmonary exacerbations during treatment with either product was 1.3 exacerbations per subject per year.
 

 Two episodes of headache were severe, defined as an inability to work or perform usual activities One subject experienced a treatment emergent serious adverse reaction (infective exacerbation of COPD), considered possibly related to treatment with GLASSIA due to its temporal association.



 A total of 3 subjects (approximately 5%) receiving GLASSIA reported urticaria, irrespective of the investigator's opinion of cause.



 Testing for viral markers for HBV, HCV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 showed no seroconversions during either trial.



 In a trial in 30 healthy adults, in which each subject received 2 infusions of GLASSIA in a dose of 60 mg/kg body weight at either of 2 infusion rates in a crossover design, a total of 13 adverse reactions were reported. In this trial, the safety profile of GLASSIA when infused at 0.2 mL/kg/min was similar to that when infused at 0.04 mL/kg/min. The most common adverse reaction was headache, occurring in 2 [7%] subjects receiving GLASSIA at 0.2 mL/kg/min and 2 [7%] of subjects receiving GLASSIA at 0.04 mL/kg/min. No infusions were slowed, interrupted or terminated due to an adverse reaction. All adverse reactions were mild (defined as a transient discomfort that did not interfere in a significant manner with the subject's normal functioning level, or an adverse event that resolved spontaneously or may have required minimal therapeutic intervention), and occurred during or within the first 72 hours after the completion of an infusion.



 In the trial in healthy adults, testing for viral markers for HBV, HCV, HIV-1, HIV-2, HAV and PVB19 showed no seroconversions.



  



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of GLASSIA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders  : Dyspnea



   Gastrointestinal Disorders  : Nausea



   General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions  : Fatigue

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions may occur in IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA. (  5.1  ) 
 *  May carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents such as viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent, despite manufacturing steps designed to minimize the risk of viral transmission. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  GLASSIA may contain trace amounts of IgA. Patients with known antibodies to IgA, which can be present in patients with selective or severe IgA deficiency, have a greater risk of developing severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Monitor vital signs continuously and observe the patient carefully throughout the infusion. Discontinue the infusion if hypersensitivity symptoms occur and administer appropriate emergency treatment. Have epinephrine and other appropriate supportive therapy available for the treatment of any acute anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction.



    5.2 Transmissible Infectious Agents



  Because this product is made from human plasma, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, such as viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. The risk of transmitting an infectious agent has been minimized by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain current virus infections and by inactivating and removing certain viruses during the manufacturing process. Despite these measures, such products may still potentially transmit human pathogenic agents.



 All infections thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to Kamada Ltd. at 1-866-GLASSIA or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.



 No seroconversions for hepatitis B or C (HBV or HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or any other known infectious agent were reported with the use of GLASSIA during the clinical trials.
