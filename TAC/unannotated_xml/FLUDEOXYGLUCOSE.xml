    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



  



    EXCERPT:    *  Radiation risks: use smallest dose necessary for imaging (  5.1  ). 
 *  Blood glucose abnormalities: may cause suboptimal imaging (  5.2  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Radiation Risks



  Radiation-emitting products, including Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection, may increase the risk for cancer, especially in pediatric patients.  Use the smallest dose necessary for imaging and ensure safe handling to protect the patient and health care worker [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ].



    5.2 Blood Glucose Abnormalities



  In the oncology and neurology setting, suboptimal imaging may occur in patients with inadequately regulated blood glucose levels.  In these patients, consider medical therapy and laboratory testing to assure at least two days of normoglycemia prior to Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection administration.
