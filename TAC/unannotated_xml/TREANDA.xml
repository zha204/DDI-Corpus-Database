  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  



 The data described below reflect exposure to TREANDA in 153 patients with CLL studied in an active-controlled, randomized trial.  The population was 45-77 years of age, 63% male, 100% white, and were treatment naive. All patients started the study at a dose of 100 mg/m  2  intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 every 28 days. 



 Adverse reactions were reported according to NCI CTC v.2.0.  Non-hematologic adverse reactions (any grade) in the TREANDA group that occurred with a frequency greater than 15% were pyrexia (24%), nausea (20%), and vomiting (16%).  



 Other adverse reactions seen frequently in one or more studies included asthenia, fatigue, malaise, and weakness; dry mouth; somnolence; cough; constipation; headache; mucosal inflammation and stomatitis. 



 Worsening hypertension was reported in 4 patients treated with TREANDA in the CLL trial and in none treated with chlorambucil.  Three of these 4 adverse reactions were described as a hypertensive crisis and were managed with oral medications and resolved.



 The most frequent adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal for patients receiving TREANDA were hypersensitivity (2%) and pyrexia (1%).



 Table 1 contains the treatment emergent adverse reactions, regardless of attribution, that were reported in &gt;= 5% of patients in either treatment group in the randomized CLL clinical study.

           The Grade 3 and 4 hematology laboratory test values by treatment group in the randomized CLL clinical study are described in Table 2. These findings confirm the myelosuppressive effects seen in patients treated with TREANDA. Red blood cell transfusions were administered to 20% of patients receiving TREANDA compared with 6% of patients receiving chlorambucil.

           In the CLL trial, 34% of patients had bilirubin elevations, some without associated significant elevations in AST and ALT.  Grade 3 or 4 increased bilirubin occurred in 3% of patients.  Increases in AST and ALT of Grade 3 or 4 were limited to 1% and 3% of patients, respectively.  Patients treated with TREANDA may also have changes in their creatinine levels. If abnormalities are detected, monitoring of these parameters should be continued to ensure that further deterioration does not occur.
 

   Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma  



 The data described below reflect exposure to TREANDA in 176 patients with indolent B-cell NHL treated in two single-arm studies.  The population was 31-84 years of age, 60% male, and 40% female.  The race distribution was 89% White, 7% Black, 3% Hispanic, 1% other, and &lt;1% Asian. These patients received TREANDA at a dose of 120 mg/m  2  intravenously on Days 1 and 2 for up to eight 21-day cycles.



 The adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of the NHL patients, regardless of severity, are shown in Table 3. The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (&gt;=30%) were nausea (75%), fatigue (57%), vomiting (40%), diarrhea (37%) and pyrexia (34%).  The most common non-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (&gt;=5%) were fatigue (11%), febrile neutropenia (6%), and pneumonia, hypokalemia and dehydration, each reported in 5% of patients.

  *Patients may have reported more than 1 adverse reaction.NOTE: Patients counted only once in each preferred term category and once in each system organ class category.    
         Hematologic toxicities, based on laboratory values and CTC grade, in NHL patients treated in both single arm studies combined are described in Table 4.  Clinically important chemistry laboratory values that were new or worsened from baseline and occurred in &gt;1% of patients at Grade 3 or 4,  in NHL patients treated in both single arm studies combined were hyperglycemia (3%), elevated creatinine (2%), hyponatremia (2%), and hypocalcemia (2%).

                           Percent of patients    
  Hematology variable      All Grades     Grades 3/4     
  Lymphocytes Decreased    99             94             
  Leukocytes Decreased     94             56             
  Hemoglobin Decreased     88             11             
  Neutrophils Decreased    86             60             
  Platelets Decreased      86             25             
         In both studies, serious adverse reactions, regardless of causality, were reported in 37% of patients receiving TREANDA.  The most common serious adverse reactions occurring in &gt;=5% of patients were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia.  Other important serious adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and/or postmarketing experience were acute renal failure, cardiac failure, hypersensitivity, skin reactions, pulmonary fibrosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome.
 

 Serious drug-related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials included myelosuppression, infection, pneumonia, tumor lysis syndrome and infusion reactions  [see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5  )]  . Adverse reactions occurring less frequently but possibly related to TREANDA treatment were hemolysis, dysgeusia/taste disorder, atypical pneumonia, sepsis, herpes zoster, erythema, dermatitis, and skin necrosis. 



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of TREANDA.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: anaphylaxis; and injection or infusion site reactions including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, and swelling; pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and pneumonitis.



 Skin reactions including SJS and TEN have occurred when TREANDA was administered concomitantly with allopurinol and other medications known to cause these syndromes.    [see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.5  )]  
</Section>
    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Myelosuppression:  Delay or reduce dose. Restart treatment based on ANC and platelet count recovery. (  2.2  ) Complications of myelosuppression may lead to death. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Infections:  Monitor for fever and other signs of infection and treat promptly. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions: Severe and anaphylactic reactions have occurred; monitor clinically and discontinue TREANDA. Pre-medicate in subsequent cycles for milder reactions. (  5.3  ) 
 *    Tumor Lysis Syndrome:  Acute renal failure and death; anticipate and use supportive measures. (  5.4  ) 
 *    Skin Reactions:  Discontinue for severe skin reactions. Cases of SJS and TEN, some fatal, have been reported when TREANDA was administered concomitantly with allopurinol and other medications known to cause these syndromes. (  5.5  ) 
 *    Other Malignancies: Pre-malignant and malignant diseases have been reported. (  5.6  ) 
 *    Extravasation: Assure good venous access and monitor infusion site during and after administration. (  5.7  ) 
 *    Embryo-fetal toxicity:  Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when receiving TREANDA. (  5.8  ,  8.1  ) 
    
 

   5.1  Myelosuppression



  TREANDA caused severe myelosuppression (Grade 3-4) in 98% of patients in the two NHL studies (see Table 4). Three patients (2%) died from myelosuppression-related adverse reactions; one each from neutropenic sepsis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia from an opportunistic infection (CMV).



 In the event of treatment-related myelosuppression, monitor leukocytes, platelets, hemoglobin (Hgb), and neutrophils frequently. In the clinical trials, blood counts were monitored every week initially. Hematologic nadirs were observed predominantly in the third week of therapy. Myelosuppression may require dose delays and/or subsequent dose reductions if recovery to the recommended values has not occurred by the first day of the next scheduled cycle. Prior to the initiation of the next cycle of therapy, the ANC should be &gt;= 1 x 10  9  /L and the platelet count should be &gt;= 75 x 10  9  /L. [see  Dosage and Administration  (  2.2  ) and (  2.3  )]  



    5.2  Infections



  Infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, and death have occurred in adult and pediatric patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports. Patients with myelosuppression following treatment with TREANDA are more susceptible to infections. Advise patients with myelosuppression following TREANDA treatment to contact a physician if they have symptoms or signs of infection.



    5.3  Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions



  Infusion reactions to TREANDA have occurred commonly in clinical trials. Symptoms include fever, chills, pruritus and rash. In rare instances severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have occurred, particularly in the second and subsequent cycles of therapy. Monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions. Ask patients about symptoms suggestive of infusion reactions after their first cycle of therapy. Patients who experience Grade 3 or worse allergic-type reactions should not be rechallenged. Consider measures to prevent severe reactions, including antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids in subsequent cycles in patients who have experienced Grade 1 or 2 infusion reactions. Discontinue TREANDA for patients with Grade 4 infusion reactions. Consider discontinuation for Grade 3 infusions reactions as clinically appropriate considering individual benefits, risks, and supportive care.



    5.4  Tumor Lysis Syndrome



  Tumor lysis syndrome associated with TREANDA treatment has occurred in patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports. The onset tends to be within the first treatment cycle of TREANDA and, without intervention, may lead to acute renal failure and death. Preventive measures include vigorous hydration and close monitoring of blood chemistry, particularly potassium and uric acid levels. Allopurinol has also been used during the beginning of TREANDA therapy. However, there may be an increased risk of severe skin toxicity when TREANDA and allopurinol are administered concomitantly [see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.5  )]  .



    5.5  Skin Reactions



  Skin reactions have been reported with TREANDA treatment in clinical trials and postmarketing safety reports, including rash, toxic skin reactions and bullous exanthema. Some events occurred when TREANDA was given in combination with other anticancer agents.



 In a study of TREANDA (90 mg/m  2  ) in combination with rituximab, one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) occurred. TEN has been reported for rituximab (see rituximab package insert). Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and TEN, some fatal, have been reported when TREANDA was administered concomitantly with allopurinol and other medications known to cause these syndromes. The relationship to TREANDA cannot be determined.



 Where skin reactions occur, they may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. Monitor patients with skin reactions closely. If skin reactions are severe or progressive, withhold or discontinue TREANDA.



    5.6  Other Malignancies



  There are reports of pre-malignant and malignant diseases that have developed in patients who have been treated with TREANDA, including myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, acute myeloid leukemia and bronchial carcinoma.  The association with TREANDA therapy has not been determined.



    5.7  Extravasation Injury



  TREANDA extravasations have been reported in post marketing resulting in hospitalizations from erythema, marked swelling, and pain. Assure good venous access prior to starting TREANDA infusion and monitor the intravenous infusion site for redness, swelling, pain, infection, and necrosis during and after administration of TREANDA.



    5.8  Embryo-fetal Toxicity



  TREANDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  Single intraperitoneal doses of bendamustine in mice and rats administered during organogenesis caused an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations, and decreased fetal body weights.
