    <Section name="adverse reactions" id="S1">      Local Reactions:  The occurrence of a hive 5 to 15 minutes after the subcutaneous injection of extract does not require a reduction in dosage. However, a local reaction with edema larger than 2 cm in diameter or swelling and redness that persist for several hours or longer indicates that too much extract has been given. Treatment should be altered as follows:



 *  Additional injections should not be given until all evidence of the reaction has disappeared. 
 *  The next injection administered should be 50% of the last non-reacting dose or less, depending upon the size and severity of the local reaction. 
 *  Subsequent injections should be continued at the reduced dosage unless the physician responsible for treatment believes that it is safe to increase the dose, and that possible clinical improvement would result from the administration of a larger dose of extract. 
      Systemic Reactions:  Systemic (generalized) reactions may range from a mild exacerbation of the patient's allergic symptoms to hives, anaphylactic shock, or even death from anaphylaxis. The reaction usually occurs 5 to 20 minutes after injection. As a rule, the more quickly a reaction develops, the more serious it is likely to become. Symptoms may include sneezing, coughing, itching, shortness of breath, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypotension and respiratory failure in severe cases. The reaction is usually stopped by the subcutaneous injection of Epinephrine HCL 1:1,000 (See Overdosage below). The oral administration of antihistamines and the placement of a tourniquet proximal to the injection site are helpful adjuncts. In the event that additional measures are required, it may be necessary to treat the patient for BRONCHOSPASM with intravenous aminophylline, intravenous fluids and corticosteroids; for HYPOTENSION with vasopressors, volume repletion, isoproterenol and corticosteroids; for LARYNGEAL OBSTRUCTION with oxygen and tracheostomy; and for CARDIAC ARREST with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other appropriate measures.Immunotherapy after anaphylaxis should only be continued if the cause of the reaction can be identified and appropriate precautions taken to insure that a subsequent reaction does not occur.

    BOXED WARNING: 

    WARNINGS  

This allergenic product is intended for use by physicians who are experienced in the administration of allergenic extracts and the emergency care of anaphylaxis, or for use under the guidance of an allergy specialist.

  

This allergenic extract is not directly interchangeable with other allergenic extracts. The initial dose must be based on skin testing as described in the dosage and administration section of this insert. Patients being switched from other types of extracts, such as alum precipitated extracts, should be started as though they were coming under treatment for the first time. Patients should be instructed to recognize adverse reaction symptoms and cautioned to contact the physician's office if reaction symptoms occur. As with all allergenic extracts, severe systemic reactions may occur. In certain individuals these reactions may be life threatening. Patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes following treatment, and emergency measures as well as personnel trained in their use should be immediately available in the event of a life threatening reaction.

  

This product should not be injected intravenously (see
