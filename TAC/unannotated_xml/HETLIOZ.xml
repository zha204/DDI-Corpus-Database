  EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;5% and at least twice as high on HETLIOZ than on placebo) were headache, increased alanine aminotransferase, nightmares or unusual dreams, and upper respiratory or urinary tract infection (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 A total of 1346 subjects were treated with at least one dose of HETLIOZ, of which 139 were treated for &gt; 26 weeks and 93 were treated for &gt; 1 year.



 A 26-week, parallel-arm placebo-controlled study (Study 1) evaluated HETLIOZ (n=42) compared to placebo (n=42) in patients with Non-24. A randomized-withdrawal, placebo- controlled study of 8 weeks duration (Study 2) also evaluated HETLIOZ (n=10), compared to placebo (n=10), in patients with Non-24.



 In placebo-controlled studies, 6% of patients exposed to HETLIOZ discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, compared with 4% of patients who received placebo.



   Table 1  shows the incidence of adverse reactions from Study 1.




  *Adverse reactions with an incidence &gt; 5% and at least twice as high on HETLIOZ than on placebo are displayed.
