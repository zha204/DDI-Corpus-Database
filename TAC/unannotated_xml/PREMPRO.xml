  6.1 Clinical Study Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In a 1-year clinical trial that included 678 postmenopausal women treated with PREMPRO and 351 postmenopausal women treated with PREMPHASE, the following adverse events occurred at a rate &gt;= 5 percent, see  Table 1  .

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS, BREAST CANCER, ENDOMETRIAL CANCER and PROBABLE DEMENTIA

    WARNING: CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS, BREAST CANCER, ENDOMETRIAL CANCER and PROBABLE DEMENTIA  

      Estrogen Plus Progestin Therapy    



   Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia  



   Estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ,   5.3  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.6  ,   14.7  )]  .  



   The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, stroke and myocardial infarction in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 5.6 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogen (CE) [0.625 mg] combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) [2.5 mg], relative to placebo   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.6  )]  .  



   The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) combined with MPA (2.5 mg), relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.7  )]  .  



   Breast Cancer  



   The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.6  )]  .  



   In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and MPA and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins.  



   Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.  



     Estrogen-Alone Therapy    



   Endometrial Cancer  



   There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .  



   Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia  



   Estrogen-alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ,   5.3  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.6  ,   14.7  )]  .  



   The WHI estrogen-alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 7.1 years of treatment with daily oral CE (0.625 mg), relative to placebo   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.6  )]  .  



   The WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 5.2 years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone, relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.7  )]  .  



   In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and other dosage forms of estrogens.  



   Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

 PREMPHASE  (r)  



 (Conjugated Estrogens plus Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Tablets) 



 Read this PATIENT INFORMATION before you start taking PREMPRO or PREMPHASE and read what you get each time you refill your PREMPRO or PREMPHASE prescription. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. 



     What is the most important information I should know about PREMPRO and PREMPHASE (combinations of estrogens and a progestin)?  



 *  Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline of brain function) 
 *  Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chances of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, or blood clots 
 *  Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older 
 *  Do not use estrogen-alone to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, or dementia 
 *  Using estrogen-alone may increase your chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb) 
 *  Using estrogen-alone may increase your chances of getting strokes or blood clots 
 *  Using estrogen-alone may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older 
 *  You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with PREMPRO or PREMPHASE 
        What is PREMPRO or PREMPHASE?  
 

 PREMPRO or PREMPHASE are medicines that contain two kinds of hormones, estrogens and a progestin. 



     PREMPRO or PREMPHASE is used after menopause to:  

    *  Reduce moderate to severe hot flashesEstrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 and 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause." When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women get very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women the symptoms are mild, and they will not need to take estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe. 
 *  Treat menopausal changes in and around the vaginaYou and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with PREMPRO or PREMPHASE to control these problems. If you use PREMPRO or PREMPHASE only to treat your menopausal changes in and around your vagina, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you. 
 *  Help reduce your chances of getting osteoporosis (thin weak bones)Osteoporosis from menopause is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and easier to break. If you use PREMPRO or PREMPHASE only to prevent osteoporosis due to menopause, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a different treatment or medicine without estrogens might be better for you. Weight-bearing exercise, like walking or running, and taking calcium (1500 mg/day of elemental calcium) and vitamin D (400-800 IU/day) supplements may also lower your chances of getting postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is important to talk about exercise and supplements with your healthcare provider before starting them. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with PREMPRO or PREMPHASE. 
        Who should not take PREMPRO or PREMPHASE?  
     Do not take PREMPRO or PREMPHASE if you have had your uterus (womb) removed (hysterectomy).  

  PREMPRO and PREMPHASE contain a progestin to decrease the chance of getting cancer of the uterus. If you do not have a uterus, you do not need a progestin and you should not take PREMPRO or PREMPHASE. 



     Do not take PREMPRO or PREMPHASE if you:  

    *  Have unusual vaginal bleeding 
 *  Currently have or have had certain cancersEstrogens may increase the chance of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast or uterus. If you have or have had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should use PREMPRO or PREMPHASE. 
 *  Had a stroke or heart attack 
 *  Currently have or have had blood clots 
 *  Currently have or have had liver problems 
 *  Have been diagnosed with a bleeding disorder 
 *  Are allergic to PREMPRO or PREMPHASE or any of their ingredientsSee the end of this leaflet for a list of ingredients in PREMPRO and PREMPHASE. 
 *  Think you may be pregnant 
        Tell your healthcare provider  
     *  If you have any unusual vaginal bleedingVaginal bleeding after menopause may be a warning sign of cancer of the uterus (womb). Your healthcare provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause. 
 *  About all of your medical problemsYour healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions, such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), diabetes, migraine, endometriosis, lupus, problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium levels in your blood. 
 *  About all the medicines you takeThis includes prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how PREMPRO or PREMPHASE works. PREMPRO or PREMPHASE may also affect how your other medicines work. 
 *  If you are going to have surgery or will be on bedrestYou may need to stop taking estrogens and progestins. 
 *  If you are breastfeedingThe hormones in PREMPRO and PREMPHASE can pass into your milk. 
        How should I take PREMPRO or PREMPHASE?  
     *  Take one PREMPRO or PREMPHASE tablet at the same time each day 
 *  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possibleIf it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your normal schedule. Do not take 2 doses at the same time. 
 *  Estrogens should be used at the lowest dose possible for your treatment only as long as neededYou and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (for example, every 3 to 6 months) about the dose you are taking and whether you still need treatment with PREMPRO or PREMPHASE. 
        What are the possible side effects of PREMPRO or PREMPHASE?  
     Side effects are grouped by how serious they are and how often they happen when you are treated.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Estrogens increase the risk of gallbladder disease (  5.4  ) 
 *  Discontinue estrogen if severe hypercalcemia, loss of vision, severe hypertriglyceridemia or cholestatic jaundice occurs (  5.5  ,  5.6  ,  5.9  ,  5.10  ) 
 *  Monitor thyroid function in women on thyroid replacement therapy (  5.11  ,  5.18  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Cardiovascular Disorders



  An increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stroke and myocardial infarction has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogens with or without progestins should be discontinued immediately.



 Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (for example, personal history of venous thromboembolism [VTE], obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.



     Stroke  



  In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in all women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years) [see Clinical Studies (  14.6  )]  . The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted.  1  Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.



 In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year one and persisted [see Clinical Studies (  14.6  )]  .



 Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg) versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).  1  



     Coronary Heart Disease  



  In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years).  1  An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 [see Clinical Studies (  14.6  )]  .



 In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], silent MI, or CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo  2    [see Clinical Studies (     14.6     )]  .



 Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non-significant reduction in CHD events (CE 0.625 mg compared to placebo) in women with less than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years).  1  



 In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763), average age 66.7 years, in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during subsequent years. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall.



     Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)  



  In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and pulmonary embolism [PE]) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted  3    [see Clinical Studies (     14.6     )]  . Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogens should be discontinued immediately.



 In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and pulmonary embolism [PE]) was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years  4    [see Clinical Studies (     14.6     )]  .



 If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.



    5.2 Malignant Neoplasms



    Endometrial Cancer  



  Endometrial hyperplasia (a possible precursor of endometrial cancer) has been reported to occur at a rate of approximately 1 percent or less with PREMPRO or PREMPHASE.



 An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in nonusers, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.



 Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.



 There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.



     Breast Cancer  



  The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin WHI substudy reported an increased risk of breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo.  5  Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger and diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups [see Clinical Studies (  14.6  )]  .



 The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg). In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg) was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80]    6    [see Clinical Studies (     14.6     )]  .



 Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.



 The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.



 All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.



     Ovarian Cancer  



  The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent nCI 0.77-3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.  7  In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen-plus progestin and estrogen-only products has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer over multiple years of use. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies, and some report no association.



    5.3 Probable Dementia



  In the estrogen plus progestin Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), an ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo.



 In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, after an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent nCI 1.21-3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years  8   [see Use in Specific Populations (     8.5     ), and Clinical Studies (     14.7  )]  .



 In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) or placebo.



 In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study, after an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent nCI 0.83-2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years  8   [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.7  )]  .



 When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent nCI 1.19-2.60). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women  8   [see Use in Specific Populations (     8.5     ), and Clinical Studies (     14.7  )]  .



    5.4 Gallbladder Disease



  A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.



    5.5 Hypercalcemia



  Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.



    5.6 Visual Abnormalities



  Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued.



    5.7 Addition of a Progestin When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy



  Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.



 There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer.



    5.8 Elevated Blood Pressure



  In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen.



    5.9 Hypertriglyceridemia



  In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs.



    5.10 Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice



  Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.



    5.11 Hypothyroidism



  Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4and T3serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.



    5.12 Fluid Retention



  Estrogens plus progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed.



    5.13 Hypocalcemia



  Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.



    5.14 Exacerbation of Endometriosis



  A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered.



    5.15 Angioedema



  Exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema, particularly in women with hereditary angioedema.



    5.16 Exacerbation of Other Conditions



  Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.



    5.17 Laboratory Tests



  Serum follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy.



    5.18 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions



  Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity.



 Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay), or T3levels by radioimmunoassay. T3resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4and free T3concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone.



 Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin).



 Increased plasma HDL and HDL2cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced LDL cholesterol concentrations, increased triglyceride levels.



 Impaired glucose tolerance.
