 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.



 The following are adverse events reported with    ANGELIQ    occurring in &gt;5% of subjects:

    BOXED WARNING: 

      Rx only    



     PRESCRIBING INFORMATION    



   Boxed Warnings

  Estrogens with or without progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia. (See WARNINGS, Cardiovascular disorders and Dementia.) The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study reported increased risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 5 years of treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogens (CE 0.625mg) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA 2.5mg) relative to placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular disorders and Malignant neoplasms, Breast cancer.) The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a substudy of WHI, reported increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 5.2 years of treatment with conjugated estrogens alone and during 4 years of treatment with oral conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies, WARNINGS, Dementia and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use.) Other doses of oral conjugated estrogens with medroxyprogesterone acetate, and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins were not studied in the WHI clinical trials, and, in the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar. Because of these risks, estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. 



 





    BOXED WARNING: 

    PATIENT INFORMATION  



     September 2005    



     ANGELIQ(r) TABLETS    



     (drospirenone and estradiol)    



 (an"ju    -    le    -    k') 



 Read this     PATIENT INFORMATION     before you start taking     ANGELIQ     and read what you get each time you refill     ANGELIQ    . There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your health care provider about your medical condition or your treatment.



       WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ANGELIQ (a combination of estrogen and a progestin)?    



 Do not use estrogens with or without progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, or strokes. 



 Using estrogens with or without progestins may increase your chances of getting heart attack, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with or without progestins may increase your risk of dementia. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with     ANGELIQ    .



       What is ANGELIQ?    



     ANGELIQ     is a medicine that contains two kinds of hormones, estrogen and progestin. 



     What is ANGELIQ used for?    



     ANGELIQ     is used after menopause to:



     reduce moderate to severe hot flashes.     Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause." 



 When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe. You and your health care provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with     ANGELIQ    . 



     treat moderate to severe dryness, itching, and burning in or around the vagina.     You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with     ANGELIQ     to control these problems. If you use     ANGELIQ     only to treat dryness, itching, and burning in and around your vagina, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you.



     Who should not use ANGELIQ?     



 Do not use     ANGELIQ     if you have had your uterus removed (hysterectomy). 



     ANGELIQ     contains a progestin to decrease the chances of getting cancer of the uterus. If you do not have a uterus, you do not need a progestin and you should not use     ANGELIQ    .



     Do not start taking ANGELIQ if you:    



 *  have unusual vaginal bleeding. 
 *  currently have or have had certain cancers. Estrogens may increase the chances of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast or uterus. If you have or had cancer, talk with your health care provider about whether you should take ANGELIQ. 
 *  had a stroke or heart attack in the past year. 
 *  currently have or have had blood clots. 
 *  have kidney disease, liver disease, or disease of your adrenal glands. 
 *  are allergic to ANGELIQ or any of its ingredients. See the end of this leaflet for a list of ingredients in ANGELIQ. 
 *  think you may be pregnant. 
        Tell your health care provider:    
 

 *  if you are breastfeeding. The hormone in ANGELIQ can pass into your milk. 
 *  about all of your medical problems. Your health care provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions, such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), migraine, endometriosis, lupus, hypertension (high blood pressure) or problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium levels in your blood. 
 *  about all the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how ANGELIQ works. ANGELIQ may also affect how your other medicines work. 
 *  if you are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest. You may need to stop taking estrogens. 
        How should I take ANGELIQ?    
 

 *  Take one tablet every day. 
 *  Estrogens should be used only as long as needed. The lowest effective dose of ANGELIQ has not been determined. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (for example, every 3 to 6 months) about whether you still need treatment with ANGELIQ. 
        What are the possible side effects of ANGELIQ?    
 

     ANGELIQ     is different from other hormonal medicines for menopausal symptoms because it contains drospirenone, and drospirenone may increase the potassium or lower the sodium in your blood. 



 You should not take     ANGELIQ     if you have kidney, liver or adrenal disease because these conditions may also increase the potassium in your blood. Some other medicines also increase potassium. If you regularly take another medicine that increases potassium levels, talk with your healthcare provider about whether     ANGELIQ     is right for you. In some situations, your healthcare provider may recommend testing your blood for potassium.



     Less common but serious side effects include the following and should be discussed with your healthcare provider to assess your personal risks:    



 *  Breast cancer 
 *  Cancer of the uterus 
 *  Stroke 
 *  Heart attack 
 *  Blood clots 
 *  Dementia 
 *  Gallbladder disease 
 *  Ovarian cancer 
        These are some of the warning signs of serious side effects:     
 

 *  Breast lumps 
 *  Unusual vaginal bleeding 
 *  Dizziness and faintness 
 *  Changes in speech 
 *  Severe headaches 
 *  Chest pain 
 *  Shortness of breath 
 *  Pains in your legs 
 *  Changes in vision 
 *  Vomiting 
    Call your health care provider right away if you get any of these warning signs, or any other unusual symptom that concerns you. 
 

     Common side effects include:    



 *  Headache 
 *  Breast pain 
 *  Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting 
 *  Stomach/abdominal cramps, bloating 
 *  Nausea and vomiting

 *  Fluid retention 
 *  Enlargement of benign tumors of the uterus ("fibroids") 
 *  Vaginal yeast infection 
    These are not all the possible side effects of     ANGELIQ    . For more information, ask your health care provider or pharmacist. 
 

     What can I do to lower my chances of a serious side effect with ANGELIQ?    



 Talk with your health care provider regularly about whether you should continue taking     ANGELIQ    . 



 See your health care provider right away if you get vaginal bleeding while taking     ANGELIQ    . 



 Have a breast exam and mammogram (breast X-ray) every year unless your health care provider tells you something else. If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram, you may need to have breast exams more often. 



 If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fat in the blood), diabetes, are overweight, or if you use tobacco, you may have higher chances for getting heart disease. Ask your health care provider for ways to lower your chances for getting heart disease. 



     General information about safe and effective use of ANGELIQ.    



 Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use     ANGELIQ     for conditions for which it was not prescribed. Do not give     ANGELIQ     to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them.



     Keep ANGELIQ out of the reach of children
