    BOXED WARNING: WARNING

  WARNING

    Furosemide is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can lead to a profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Therefore, careful medical supervision is required and dose and dose schedule must be adjusted to the individual patient's needs. (See   "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"  .)
