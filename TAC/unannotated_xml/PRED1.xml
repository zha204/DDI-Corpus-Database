  Adverse reactions include, in decreasing order of frequency, elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, and delayed wound healing.



 Although systemic effects are extremely uncommon, there have been rare occurrences of systemic hypercorticoidism after use of topical steroids.



 Corticosteroid-containing preparations have also been reported to cause acute anterior uveitis and perforation of the globe. Keratitis, conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, mydriasis, conjunctival hyperemia, loss of accommodation and ptosis have occasionally been reported following local use of corticosteroids.



 The development of secondary ocular infection (bacterial, fungal, and viral) have occurred. Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion should be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used (see  WARNINGS  ).



 Transient burning and stinging upon instillation and other minor symptoms of ocular irritation have been reported with the use of  PRED FORTE    (r)  suspension. Other adverse events reported with the use of  PRED FORTE    (r)  suspension include: visual disturbance (blurry vision); foreign body sensation; and allergic reactions.
