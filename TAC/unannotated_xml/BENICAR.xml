  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Adult Hypertension  Benicar has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. This experience included about 900 patients treated for at least 6 months and more than 525 for at least 1 year. Treatment with Benicar was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. Events generally were mild, transient and had no relationship to the dose of Benicar.



 The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose-related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Benicar and placebo-treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% (i.e., 79/3278) of patients treated with Benicar and 2.7% (i.e., 32/1179) of control patients. In placebo-controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Benicar and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%).The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Benicar, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis.



 The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Benicar (0.9%) patients.



 Other potentially important adverse reactions that have been reported with an incidence of greater than 0.5%, whether or not attributed to treatment, in the more than 3100 hypertensive patients treated with Benicar monotherapy in controlled or open-label trials are listed below.  Body as a Whole:  chest pain, peripheral edema  Central and Peripheral Nervous System:  vertigo  Gastrointestinal:  abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, nausea  Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders:  tachycardia  Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders:  hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipemia, hyperuricemia  Musculoskeletal:  arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia  Skin and Appendages:  rash



 Facial edema was reported in five patients receiving Benicar. Angioedema has been reported with angiotensin II antagonists.



   Laboratory Test Findings:  In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of Benicar.  Hemoglobin and Hematocrit:  Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.3 g/dL and 0.3 volume percent, respectively) were observed.  Liver Function Tests:  Elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin were observed infrequently. Five patients (0.1%) assigned to Benicar and one patient (0.2%) assigned to placebo in clinical trials were withdrawn because of abnormal liver chemistries (transaminases or total bilirubin). Of the five Benicar patients, three had elevated transaminases, which were attributed to alcohol use, and one had a single elevated bilirubin value, which normalized while treatment continued.



   Pediatric Hypertension  No relevant differences were identified between the adverse experience profile for pediatric patients aged 1 to16 years and that previously reported for adult patients.



   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing experience. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Body as a Whole:  Asthenia, angioedema, anaphylactic reactions  Gastrointestinal:  Vomiting  Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders:  Hyperkalemia  Musculoskeletal:  Rhabdomyolysis  Urogenital System:  Acute renal failure, increased blood creatinine levels  Skin and Appendages:  Alopecia, pruritus, urticaria

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: FETAL TOXICITY

  WARNING: FETAL TOXICITY

    *  When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Benicar as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
 *  Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and death to the developing fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Benicar as soon as possible (5.1). 
 *  Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and death to the developing fetus (5.1).

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Avoid fetal (in utero) exposure  (5.1)  . 
 *  Children &lt;1 year of age must not receive Benicar for hypertension  (5.2)  . 
 *  Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension in volume- or salt-depleted patients with treatment initiation  (5.3)  . 
 *  Monitor for worsening renal function in patients with renal impairment  (5.4)  . 
    
 

   5.1 Fetal Toxicity



     Pregnancy Category D    Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Benicar as soon as possible [  see Use in specific Populations (  8.1  )]  .  
 

    5.2 Morbidity in Infants



   Children &lt;1 year of age must not receive Benicar for hypertension. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) can have effects on the development of immature kidneys [see Use in Specific Populations  (8.4)  ]  .  



    5.3 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients



  In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may be anticipated after initiation of treatment with Benicar. Initiate treatment under close medical supervision. If hypotension does occur, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal saline [see Dosage and Administration  (2.1)  ]  . A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.



    5.4 Impaired Renal Function



  As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Benicar. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Benicar [see Dosage and Administration  (2.1)  , Drug Interactions  (7)  , Use in Specific Populations  (8.7)  and Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3)  ]  .



 In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been reported. There has been no long-term use of Benicar in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected.
