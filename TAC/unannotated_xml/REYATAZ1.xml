    <Section name="adverse reactions" id="S1">    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:



 *  cardiac conduction abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions  (5.2)   ] 
 *  rash [see Warnings and Precautions  (5.3)   ] 
 *  hyperbilirubinemia [see Warnings and Precautions  (5.4)   ] 
 *  nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions  (5.6)   ] 
    Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 

   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (&gt;=2%) are nausea, jaundice/scleral icterus, rash, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, insomnia, peripheral neurologic symptoms, dizziness, myalgia, diarrhea, depression, and fever.  (6.1  ,  6.2)  



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-800-721-5072 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch  



 

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults

    Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions in Treatment-Naive Patients  



 The safety profile of REYATAZ in treatment-naive adults is based on 1625 HIV-1 infected patients in clinical trials. 536 patients received REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg and 1089 patients received REYATAZ 400 mg or higher (without ritonavir).



 The most common adverse reactions are nausea, jaundice/scleral icterus, and rash.



 Selected clinical adverse reactions of moderate or severe intensity reported in &gt;=2% of treatment-naive patients receiving combination therapy including REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg and REYATAZ 400 mg (without ritonavir) are presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.

          Lipids, Change from Baseline in Treatment-Experienced Patients  
 

 For Study AI424-045, changes from baseline in LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides are shown in Table 12. The observed magnitude of dyslipidemia was less with REYATAZ/ritonavir than with lopinavir/ritonavir. However, the clinical impact of such findings has not been demonstrated.

        6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients
   The safety and tolerability of REYATAZ Capsules with and without ritonavir have been established in pediatric patients at least 6 years of age from the open-label, multicenter clinical trial PACTG 1020A. Use of REYATAZ in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age is under investigation.



 The safety profile of REYATAZ in pediatric patients (6 to less than 18 years of age) was generally similar to that observed in clinical studies of REYATAZ in adults. The most common Grade 2-4 adverse events (&gt;=5%, regardless of causality) reported in pediatric patients were cough (21%), fever (18%), jaundice/scleral icterus (15%), rash (14%), vomiting (12%), diarrhea (9%), headache (8%), peripheral edema (7%), extremity pain (6%), nasal congestion (6%), oropharyngeal pain (6%), wheezing (6%), and rhinorrhea (6%). Asymptomatic second-degree atrioventricular block was reported in &lt;2% of patients. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities occurring in pediatric patients were elevation of total bilirubin (&gt;=3.2 mg/dL, 58%), neutropenia (9%), and hypoglycemia (4%). All other Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities occurred with a frequency of less than 3%.



   6.3 Patients Co-infected With Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus

  Liver function tests should be monitored in patients with a history of hepatitis B or C.



 In study AI424-138, 60 patients treated with REYATAZ/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg once daily, and 51 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice daily, each with fixed dose tenofovir-emtricitabine, were seropositive for hepatitis B and/or C at study entry. ALT levels &gt;5 times ULN developed in 10% (6/60) of the REYATAZ/ritonavir-treated patients and 8% (4/50) of the lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients. AST levels &gt;5 times ULN developed in 10% (6/60) of the REYATAZ/ritonavir-treated patients and none (0/50) of the lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients.



 In study AI424-045, 20 patients treated with REYATAZ/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg once daily, and 18 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice daily, were seropositive for hepatitis B and/or C at study entry. ALT levels &gt;5 times ULN developed in 25% (5/20) of the REYATAZ/ritonavir-treated patients and 6% (1/18) of the lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients. AST levels &gt;5 times ULN developed in 10% (2/20) of the REYATAZ/ritonavir-treated patients and 6% (1/18) of the lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients.



 In studies AI424-008 and AI424-034, 74 patients treated with 400 mg of REYATAZ (atazanavir sulfate) once daily, 58 who received efavirenz, and 12 who received nelfinavir were seropositive for hepatitis B and/or C at study entry. ALT levels &gt;5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) developed in 15% of the REYATAZ-treated patients, 14% of the efavirenz-treated patients, and 17% of the nelfinavir-treated patients. AST levels &gt;5 times ULN developed in 9% of the REYATAZ-treated patients, 5% of the efavirenz-treated patients, and 17% of the nelfinavir-treated patients. Within atazanavir and control regimens, no difference in frequency of bilirubin elevations was noted between seropositive and seronegative patients. [See  Warnings and Precautions  (5.5)    .]



   6.4 Postmarketing Experience

  The following events have been identified during postmarketing use of REYATAZ. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Body as a Whole:  edema



   Cardiovascular System:  second-degree AV block, third-degree AV block, left bundle branch block, QTc prolongation [see  Warnings and Precautions  (5.2)    ]



   Gastrointestinal System:  pancreatitis



   Hepatic System:  hepatic function abnormalities



   Hepatobiliary Disorders:  cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholestasis



   Metabolic System and Nutrition Disorders:  diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia [see  Warnings and Precautions  (5.7)    ]



   Musculoskeletal System:  arthralgia



   Renal System:  nephrolithiasis [see  Warnings and Precautions  (5.6)    ]



   Skin and Appendages:  alopecia, maculopapular rash [see  Contraindications  (4)    and  Warnings and Precautions  (5.3)    ], pruritus
</Section>
    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



     EXCERPT:    *   Cardiac conduction abnormalities: PR interval prolongation may occur in some patients. Use with caution in patients with preexisting conduction system disease or when administered with other drugs that may prolong the PR interval.  (5.2  ,  6.4  ,  7.3  ,  12.2  ,  17.3)   
 *   Rash: Discontinue if severe rash develops.  (5.3  ,  6.4  ,  17.4)   
 *   Hyperbilirubinemia: Most patients experience asymptomatic increases in indirect bilirubin, which is reversible upon discontinuation. Do not dose reduce. If a concomitant transaminase increase occurs, evaluate for alternative etiologies.  (5.4  ,  6.2)   
 *   Hepatotoxicity: REYATAZ should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment  (5.5)  . Patients with hepatitis B or C infection are at risk of increased transaminases or hepatic decompensation. Monitor hepatic laboratory tests prior to therapy and during treatment.  (2.5  ,  5.5  ,  6.3  ,  6.4  ,  8.8)   
 *   Nephrolithiasis has been reported. Consider temporary interruption or discontinuation.  (5.6  ,  6.4)   
 *  Patients receiving REYATAZ may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia  (5.7  ,  6.4)  , immune reconstitution syndrome  (5.8)  , and redistribution/accumulation of body fat.  (5.9)   
 *   Hemophilia: Spontaneous bleeding may occur and additional factor VIII may be required.  (5.10)   
    
 

   5.1 Drug Interactions



  See Table 3 for a listing of drugs that are contraindicated for use with REYATAZ due to potentially life-threatening adverse events, significant drug interactions, or loss of virologic activity. [See Contraindications  (4)    .] Please refer to Table 13 for established and other potentially significant drug interactions [see Drug Interactions  (7.3)    ].



    5.2 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities



  Atazanavir has been shown to prolong the PR interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. In healthy volunteers and in patients, abnormalities in atrioventricular (AV) conduction were asymptomatic and generally limited to first-degree AV block. There have been reports of second-degree AV block and other conduction abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions  (6.4)    and Overdosage  (10)    ]. In clinical trials that included electrocardiograms, asymptomatic first-degree AV block was observed in 5.9% of atazanavir-treated patients (n=920), 5.2% of lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients (n=252), 10.4% of nelfinavir-treated patients (n=48), and 3.0% of efavirenz-treated patients (n=329). In Study AI424-045, asymptomatic first-degree AV block was observed in 5% (6/118) of atazanavir/ritonavir-treated patients and 5% (6/116) of lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients who had on-study electrocardiogram measurements. Because of limited clinical experience in patients with preexisting conduction system disease (eg, marked first-degree AV block or second- or third-degree AV block), atazanavir should be used with caution in these patients. [See Clinical Pharmacology  (12.2)    .]



 Atazanavir in combination with diltiazem increased diltiazem plasma concentration by 2-fold with an additive effect on the PR interval. When used in combination with atazanavir, a dose reduction of diltiazem by one-half should be considered and ECG monitoring is recommended. In a pharmacokinetic study between atazanavir 400 mg once daily and atenolol 50 mg once daily, no clinically significant additive effect of atazanavir and atenolol on the PR interval was observed. Dose adjustment of atenolol is not required when used in combination with atazanavir. [See Drug Interactions  (7)    and Clinical Pharmacology  (12.2)    .] Pharmacokinetic studies between atazanavir and other drugs that prolong the PR interval including beta blockers [other than atenolol, see Drug Interactions  (7)    ], verapamil, and digoxin have not been performed. An additive effect of atazanavir and these drugs cannot be excluded; therefore, caution should be exercised when atazanavir is given concurrently with these drugs, especially those that are metabolized by CYP3A (eg, verapamil).



    5.3 Rash



  In controlled clinical trials, rash (all grades, regardless of causality) occurred in approximately 20% of patients treated with REYATAZ. The median time to onset of rash in clinical studies was 7.3 weeks and the median duration of rash was 1.4 weeks. Rashes were generally mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions of moderate or severe rash (occurring at a rate of &gt;=2%) are presented for the individual clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions  (6.1)    ]. Dosing with REYATAZ was often continued without interruption in patients who developed rash. The discontinuation rate for rash in clinical trials was &lt;1%. REYATAZ should be discontinued if severe rash develops. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and toxic skin eruptions have been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ. [See Contraindications  (4)    .]



    5.4 Hyperbilirubinemia



  Most patients taking REYATAZ experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT). This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of REYATAZ. Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. No long-term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin &gt;5 times ULN. Alternative antiretroviral therapy to REYATAZ may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long-term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established. [See Adverse Reactions  (6.1  ,  6.2)    .]



    5.5 Hepatotoxicity



  Caution should be exercised when administering REYATAZ to patients with hepatic impairment because atazanavir concentrations may be increased. [See Dosage and Administration  (2.5)    .] Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C viral infections or marked elevations in transaminases before treatment may be at increased risk for developing further transaminase elevations or hepatic decompensation. In these patients, hepatic laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with REYATAZ and during treatment. [See Adverse Reactions  (6.3)    and Use in Specific Populations  (8.8)    .]



    5.6 Nephrolithiasis



  Cases of nephrolithiasis were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving REYATAZ therapy. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered. [See Adverse Reactions  (6.4)    .]



    5.7 Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia



  New-onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established. [See Adverse Reactions  (6.4)    .]



    5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including REYATAZ. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.



    5.9 Fat Redistribution



  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.



    5.10 Hemophilia



  There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis, in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established.



    5.11 Resistance/Cross-Resistance



  Various degrees of cross-resistance among protease inhibitors have been observed. Resistance to atazanavir may not preclude the subsequent use of other protease inhibitors. [See Clinical Pharmacology  (12.4)    .]
