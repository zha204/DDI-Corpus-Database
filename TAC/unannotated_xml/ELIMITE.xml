  In clinical trials, generally mild and transient burning and stinging followed application with ELIMITE  TM  (permethrin) 5% Cream in 10% of patients and was associated with the severity of infestation. Pruritus was reported in 7% of patients at various times post-application. Erythema, numbness, tingling, and rash were reported in 1 to 2% or less of patients (see    PRECAUTIONS - General    ). Other adverse events reported since marketing ELIMITE  TM  (permethrin) 5% Cream include: headache, fever, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea and/or vomiting. Although extremely uncommon and not expected when used as directed (see    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ), rare occurrences of seizure have been reported.
