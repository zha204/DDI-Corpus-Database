    6.1     Clinical Trials Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Clinical Trial Experience with CARNEXIV  



 The data described below are based on an open-label 7-day study with CARNEXIV in 98 patients, and an open-label 5-day study with CARNEXIV in 105 patients. All infusions were administered in equally divided doses given separately every 6 hours. Of the 203 patients in the studies, 160 received multiple 15-minute infusions and 43 received multiple 30-minute infusions. Most patients received a total daily intravenous dose ranging from 280 mg to 1,120 mg (equivalent to total daily oral dose of 400 mg to 1,600 mg) in divided doses given every 6 hours. Eight patients received up to 1,400 mg total daily intravenous dose (equivalent to total daily oral dose of 2,000 mg).



  



 The most common adverse reactions in all patients during treatment with CARNEXIV (incidence greater than or equal to 2%) were dizziness, somnolence, blurred vision, diplopia, headache, infusion-related reaction, infusion site pain, and anemia (Table 4).

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: SERIOUS DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS and APLASTIC ANEMIA AND AGRANULOCYTOSIS

    WARNING: SERIOUS DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS and APLASTIC ANEMIA AND AGRANULOCYTOSIS  

      Serious Dermatologic Reactions and HLA-B*1502 Allele       Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have occurred in patients treated with carbamazepine. There is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA-B gene that is found almost exclusively in patients with Asian ancestry. Avoid use of CARNEXIV in patients testing positive for the allele unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Discontinue CARNEXIV if you suspect that the patient is having a serious dermatologic reaction   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .   



     Aplastic Anemia and Agranulocytosis      Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis can occur during treatment with CARNEXIV. Obtain a complete blood count (CBC) before beginning treatment with CARNEXIV, and monitor CBC periodically. Consider discontinuing CARNEXIV if significant bone marrow depression develops   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].    



   EXCERPT:     WARNING: SERIOUS DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS     and APLASTIC ANEMIA AND AGRANULOCYTOSIS      See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning             



     Serious Dermatologic Reactions    



 *  Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have occurred with carbamazepine. Discontinue CARNEXIV if these reactions occur (5.1). 
 *  Patients of Asian ancestry have a 10-fold greater risk of TEN/SJS, compared to other populations. Avoid use of CARNEXIV in genetically at-risk patients, including those positive for the HLA-B*1502 allele (5.1). 
        Aplastic Anemia and Agranulocytosis     
 

 *  Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis can occur with CARNEXIV (5.2) 
 *  Obtain complete CBC prior to initiation of CARNEXIV. Consider discontinuing CARNEXIV if significant bone marrow depression develops (5.2).

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">     5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *    Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity:  Monitor for hypersensitivity; discontinue if another cause cannot be established (  5.4  ) 
 *    Suicidal Behavior and Ideation:  Monitor for depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and unusual changes in mood or behavior (  5.5  ) 
 *    Embryofetal Toxicity:  Advise women of childbearing potential of possible risks to the fetus (  5.6  ,  8.1  ) 
 *    Abrupt Discontinuation and Seizure Risk:  Do not discontinue CARNEXIV treatment abruptly (  5.7  ) 
 *    Hyponatremia:  Consider discontinuing CARNEXIV in patients with significant symptomatic hyponatremia (  5.8  ) 
 *    Hepatic Toxicity; Hepatic Porphyria:  Evaluate liver function before and periodically during treatment; avoid CARNEXIV use in patients with hepatic porphyria (  5.10  ,  5.12  ) 
    
 

    5.1     Serious Dermatologic Reactions  



  Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with carbamazepine treatment. These syndromes may be accompanied by mucous membrane ulcers, fever, or painful rash. Over 90% of carbamazepine-treated patients who experienced SJS/TEN developed these reactions within the first few months of treatment. The risk of these reactions is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Discontinue CARNEXIV if you suspect that the patient is having a serious dermatologic reaction. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, do not resume treatment with CARNEXIV.



   SJS, TEN, and HLA-B*1502 Allele       Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry, there is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN with carbamazepine treatment and the presence of the HLA-B*1502 allele (an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene). Prior to initiating carbamazepine therapy, patients with a higher likelihood for this allele should be screened for the presence of HLA-B*1502. The high-resolution genotype test is positive if one or two HLA-B*1502 alleles are present. Avoid use of CARNEXIV in patients positive for the HLA-B*1502 allele unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks of serious dermatologic reactions. Tested patients who are found to be negative for the allele are thought to have a low risk of SJS/TEN associated with carbamazepine treatment.
 

 The prevalence of the HLA-B*1502 allele may be higher in Asian populations: Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines (greater than 15%); Taiwan (10%); North China (4%); South Asians, including Indians (2% to 4%); and Japan and Korea (less than 1%). HLA-B*1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian origin (e.g., Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans). The accuracy of estimated rates of the HLA-B*1502 allele in these populations may be limited by wide variability in rates within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry.



 The HLA-B*1502 allele has not been found to predict risk of less severe adverse cutaneous reactions from carbamazepine, such as maculopapular rash, hypersensitivity syndrome or non-serious rash (maculopapular eruption [MPE]) or Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )].  



 Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Chinese ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs (AED) associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B*1502-positive patients, when alternative therapies are otherwise equally acceptable.



   Hypersensitivity Reactions and HLA-A*3101 Allele       Retrospective case-control studies in patients of European, Korean, and Japanese ancestry have found a moderate association between the risk of developing hypersensitivity reactions and the presence of HLA-A*3101, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA-A gene, in patients using carbamazepine. These hypersensitivity reactions include SJS/TEN, maculopapular eruptions, and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  .
 

 HLA-A*3101 is expected to be present in the following frequencies: greater than 15% in patients of Japanese and Native American ancestry; up to about 10% in patients of Han Chinese, Korean, European, and Latin American ancestry; and up to about 5% in African-Americans and patients of Indian, Thai, Taiwanese, and Chinese (Hong Kong) ancestry.



 The risks and benefits of carbamazepine therapy should be weighed before considering carbamazepine in patients known to be positive for HLA-A*3101.



   Hypersensitivity and Limitations of HLA Genotyping       Application of HLA-B*1502 genotyping as a screening tool has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. Many HLA-B*1502-positive Asian and HLA-A*3101-positive patients treated with carbamazepine will not develop SJS/TEN or other hypersensitivity reactions, and these reactions can still occur infrequently in HLA-B*1502-negative and HLA-A*3101-negative patients of any ethnicity. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN and other hypersensitivity reactions, such as AED dose, compliance, concomitant medications, co-morbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied.
 

     5.2     Aplastic Anemia and Agranulocytosis  



  Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis have occurred in patients treated with carbamazepine. Data from a population-based case-control study suggest that the risk of developing these reactions is 5 to 8 times greater than in the general population. However, the overall risk of these reactions in the untreated general population is low, approximately 6 patients per 1 million population per year for agranulocytosis and 2 patients per 1 million population per year for aplastic anemia.



 Although reports of transient or persistent decreased platelet or white blood cell counts are not uncommon in association with the use of carbamazepine, data are not available to estimate accurately their incidence or outcome. However, the vast majority of the cases of leukopenia have not progressed to the more serious conditions of aplastic anemia or agranulocytosis.



 Because of the very low incidence of agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia, the vast majority of minor hematologic changes observed in monitoring of patients on carbamazepine are unlikely to signal the occurrence of either abnormality. In patients not already on another formulation of carbamazepine, complete hematological testing prior to initiation of CARNEXIV should be obtained as a baseline. If a patient in the course of treatment exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely. Consider discontinuing carbamazepine if any evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops.



     5.3     Impairment of Renal Function  



  CARNEXIV may cause transient renal function impairment. Renal tubule cell vacuolization and degeneration were observed in animal studies in which carbamazepine was formulated with the solubilizing agent sulfobutylether beta-cyclodextrin sodium salt, an ingredient of CARNEXIV. In clinical studies with CARNEXIV, elevations of urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), an early marker of renal tubular injury, were observed in about 40% of patients. These elevations resolved following CARNEXIV discontinuation.  In addition, a patient with mild renal impairment prior to receiving CARNEXIV had a significant increase in serum creatinine (from 105 umol/L to 195 umol/L) during CARNEXIV treatment; creatinine partially returned to baseline values after CARNEXIV discontinuation. 



  



 Renal function and electrolytes should be monitored during treatment with CARNEXIV [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  . Patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for an adverse effect of CARNEXIV on renal function, and should be closely monitored during CARNEXIV treatment. CARNEXIV should generally not be used in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.



  



 Use of CARNEXIV for periods of more than 7 days has not been studied.



     5.4     Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity  



  Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has occurred with carbamazepine. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. CARNEXIV should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.



   Hypersensitivity       Hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine have been reported in patients who previously experienced this reaction to antiepileptics including oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, primidone, and phenobarbital. A history of hypersensitivity reactions should be obtained for patients and their immediate family members. If such history is present, benefits and risks should be carefully considered, and the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity should be carefully monitored.
 

 Patients should be informed that about a third of patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine also experience hypersensitivity reactions with oxcarbazepine (Trileptal  (r)  ).



     5.5     Suicidal Behavior and Ideation  



  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including CARNEXIV, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.



 Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk: 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.



 The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.



 The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.



  



 Anyone considering prescribing CARNEXIV, or any other AED, must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.



  



 Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.



     5.6     Embryofetal Toxicity  



  CARNEXIV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman  [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )].  Pregnancy registry and epidemiological data demonstrate an association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and congenital malformations, including spina bifida and malformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects and cardiovascular malformations). There have been postmarketing reports of developmental delays based on neurobehavioral assessments.



  



 Pregnancy registry data suggest that, compared with monotherapy, there may be a higher prevalence of teratogenic effects associated with the use of anticonvulsants in combination therapy.



  



 In animal studies, administration of carbamazepine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformations.



  



 If CARNEXIV is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking CARNEXIV, the patient should be informed of the potential risk to the fetus.



     5.7     Abrupt Discontinuation and Seizure Risk  



  Because of the risk of seizure and other withdrawal signs/symptoms, do not discontinue CARNEXIV abruptly. Patients with seizure disorders are at increased risk of developing seizures and status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.



     5.8     Hyponatremia  



  Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with CARNEXIV. In many cases, the hyponatremia appears to be caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The risk of developing SIADH with carbamazepine treatment appears to be dose-related. Elderly patients and patients treated with diuretics are at greater risk of developing hyponatremia. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, new or increased seizure frequency, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. Consider discontinuing CARNEXIV in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia.



     5.9     Potential Impairment of Neurologic Function  



  Carbamazepine has the potential to cause impairment in judgment, cognition, motor function, and motor coordination.  It also may cause dizziness, ataxia, and drowsiness. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that carbamazepine does not affect them adversely.



     5.10    Hepatic Toxicity  



  Hepatic effects, ranging from slight elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases of hepatic failure, have been reported. In some cases, hepatic effects may progress despite discontinuation of the drug. In addition, rare instances of vanishing bile duct syndrome have been reported. This syndrome consists of a cholestatic process with a variable clinical course ranging from fulminant to indolent, involving the destruction and disappearance of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Some, but not all, cases are associated with features that overlap with other immunoallergenic syndromes such as multiorgan hypersensitivity (DRESS syndrome) and serious dermatologic reactions. As an example, there has been a report of vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and in another case, an association with fever and eosinophilia. 



  



 Baseline and periodic evaluations of liver function, particularly in patients with a history of liver disease, must be performed during treatment with this drug since liver damage may occur. In the case of active liver disease, or with newly occurring or worsening clinical or laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction or hepatic damage, discontinue CARNEXIV based on clinical judgment.



     5.11    Increased Intraocular Pressure  



  Carbamazepine has mild anticholinergic activity. In patients with a history of increased intraocular pressure, consider assessing intraocular pressure before initiating treatment and periodically during therapy.



     5.12    Hepatic Porphyria  



  The use of CARNEXIV should be avoided in patients with a history of hepatic porphyria (e.g., acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda). Acute attacks have been reported in such patients receiving carbamazepine therapy. Carbamazepine administration has also been demonstrated to increase porphyrin precursors in rodents, a presumed mechanism for the induction of acute attacks of porphyria.
