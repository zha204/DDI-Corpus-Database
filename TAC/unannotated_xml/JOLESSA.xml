    BOXED WARNING: 

        Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious 

cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use. This risk increases 

with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite 

marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives should 

be strongly advised not to smoke.
