  In controlled adult clinical studies, the incidence of adverse reactions probably or possibly associated with the use of prednicarbate emollient cream 0.1% was approximately 4%  .  Reported reactions included mild signs of skin atrophy in 1% of treated patients, as well as the following reactions which were reported in less than 1% of patients: pruritis, edema, paresthesia, urticaria, burning, allergic contact dermatitis and rash.



 In an uncontrolled study in pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis, the incidence of adverse reactions possibly or probably associated with the use of prednicarbate emollient cream 0.1 % was limited. Mild signs of atrophy developed in 5 patients (5/59, 8%) during the clinical trial, with 2 patients exhibiting more than one sign. Two patients (2/59, 3%) developed shininess, and 2 patients (2/59, 3%) developed thinness. Three patients (3/59, 5 %) were observed with mild telangiectasia. It is unknown whether prior use of topical corticosteroids was a contributing factor in the development of telangiectasia in 2 of the patients  (See  PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use  .)  



 The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids, but may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, secondary infection, striae and miliaria.
