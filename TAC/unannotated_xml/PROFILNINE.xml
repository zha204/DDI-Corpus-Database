  Adverse reactions with Profilnine may include headache, fever, chills, flushing, nausea, vomiting, tingling, lethargy, urticaria, and manifestations of allergic reactions.



 The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Profilnine: hypersensitivity reactions including shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and hypotension, as well as thrombosis including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and inhibitor development. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
