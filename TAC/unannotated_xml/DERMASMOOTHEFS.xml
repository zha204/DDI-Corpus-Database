  The following local adverse reactions have been reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids. They may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings, especially with higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria. One peanut sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  .



 A post marketing (open-label) safety study was conducted in 58 children to evaluate the local safety of Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  when applied twice daily for 4 weeks to the face in children (2 to 12 years) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (see  Table of Incidence of Adverse Events  ).
