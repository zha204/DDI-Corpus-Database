  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In all controlled and uncontrolled trials in patients with partial-onset seizures, 1327 patients have received VIMPAT of whom 1000 have been treated for longer than 6 months and 852 for longer than 12 months.



   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (&gt;=10% and greater than placebo) are diplopia, headache, dizziness, nausea    (6.1)

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

    Controlled Trials

    Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation

  In controlled clinical trials, the rate of discontinuation as a result of an adverse event was 8% and 17% in patients randomized to receive VIMPAT at the recommended doses of 200 and 400 mg/day, respectively, 29% at 600 mg/day, and 5% in patients randomized to receive placebo. The adverse events most commonly (&gt;1% in the VIMPAT total group and greater than placebo) leading to discontinuation were dizziness, ataxia, vomiting, diplopia, nausea, vertigo, and vision blurred.



   Most common adverse reactions

  Table 2 gives the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in &gt;=2% of adult patients with partial-onset seizures in the total VIMPAT group and for which the incidence was greater than placebo. The majority of adverse events in the VIMPAT patients were reported with a maximum intensity of 'mild' or 'moderate'.

        Laboratory abnormalities
   Abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed in controlled trials with VIMPAT in adult patients with partial-onset seizures who were taking 1 to 3 concomitant anti-epileptic drugs. Elevations of ALT to &gt;=3* ULN occurred in 0.7% (7/935) of VIMPAT patients and 0% (0/356) of placebo patients. One case of hepatitis with transaminases &gt;20x ULN was observed in one healthy subject 10 days after VIMPAT treatment completion, along with nephritis (proteinuria and urine casts). Serologic studies were negative for viral hepatitis. Transaminases returned to normal within one month without specific treatment. At the time of this event, bilirubin was normal. The hepatitis/nephritis was interpreted as a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to VIMPAT.



   Other Adverse Reactions in Patients with Partial-Onset Seizures

  The following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse events reported by patients treated with VIMPAT in all clinical trials in patients with partial-onset seizures, including controlled trials and long-term open-label extension trials. Events addressed in other tables or sections are not listed here. Events included in this list from the controlled trials occurred more frequently on drug than on placebo and were based on consideration of VIMPAT pharmacology, frequency above that expected in the population, seriousness, and likelihood of a relationship to VIMPAT. Events are further classified within system organ class.



 Blood and lymphatic system disorders: neutropenia, anemia



 Cardiac disorders: palpitations



 Ear and labyrinth disorders: tinnitus



 Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, dyspepsia, dry mouth, oral hypoaesthesia



 General disorders and administration site conditions: irritability, pyrexia, feeling drunk



 Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications: fall



 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle spasms



 Nervous system disorders: paresthesia, cognitive disorder, hypoaesthesia, dysarthria, disturbance in attention, cerebellar syndrome



 Psychiatric disorders: confusional state, mood altered, depressed mood



   Intravenous Adverse Reactions

  Adverse reactions with intravenous administration generally appeared similar to those observed with the oral formulation, although intravenous administration was associated with local adverse events such as injection site pain or discomfort (2.5%), irritation (1%), and erythema (0.5%). One case of profound bradycardia (26 bpm: BP 100/60 mmHg) was observed in a patient during a 15 minute infusion of 150mg VIMPAT. This patient was on a beta-blocker. Infusion was discontinued and the patient experienced a rapid recovery.



   Comparison of Gender and Race

  The overall adverse event rate was similar in male and female patients. Although there were few non-Caucasian patients, no differences in the incidences of adverse events compared to Caucasian patients were observed.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of VIMPAT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Cardiac disorders: Atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, bradycardia



 Immune system disorders: Drug hypersensitivity reactions



 Psychiatric disorders: Aggression, agitation, insomnia, psychotic disorder



 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Angioedema, rash, urticaria

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



     EXCERPT:    *  Suicidal Behavior and Ideation   (5.1)    
 *  Patients should be advised that VIMPAT may cause dizziness and ataxia.   (5.2)    
 *  Caution is advised for patients with known cardiac conduction problems [e.g., second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block], who are taking drugs known to induce PR interval prolongation, or with severe cardiac disease such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure.   (5.3)    
 *  Patients should be advised that VIMPAT may cause syncope.   (5.4)    
 *  In patients with seizure disorders, VIMPAT should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency.   (5.5)    
 *  Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions   (5.6)    
 *  Phenylketonurics   (5.7)    
    
 

   5.1 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation



  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including VIMPAT, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.



 Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.



 The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.



 The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.



 Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

 Epilepsy              1.0                   3.4                   3.5                   2.4                    
 Psychiatric           5.7                   8.5                   1.5                   2.9                    
 Other                 1.0                   1.8                   1.9                   0.9                    
 Total                 2.4                   4.3                   1.8                   1.9                    
           The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar.
 

 Anyone considering prescribing VIMPAT or any other AED must balance this risk with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which antiepileptics are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.



 Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.



    5.2 Dizziness and Ataxia



  Patients should be advised that VIMPAT may cause dizziness and ataxia. Accordingly, they should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other complex machinery until they are familiar with the effects of VIMPAT on their ability to perform such activities.



 In patients with partial-onset seizures taking 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs, dizziness was experienced by 25% of patients randomized to the recommended doses (200 to 400 mg/day) of VIMPAT (compared with 8% of placebo patients) and was the adverse event most frequently leading to discontinuation (3%). Ataxia was experienced by 6% of patients randomized to the recommended doses (200 to 400 mg/day) of VIMPAT (compared to 2% of placebo patients). The onset of dizziness and ataxia was most commonly observed during titration. There was a substantial increase in these adverse events at doses higher than 400 mg/day. [see Adverse Reactions/  Table 2     (6.1)    ]



    5.3 Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities



     PR interval prolongation



  Dose-dependent prolongations in PR interval with VIMPAT have been observed in clinical studies in patients and in healthy volunteers. [see Clinical Pharmacology  (12.2)  ]  In clinical trials in patients with partial-onset epilepsy, asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.4% (4/944) of patients randomized to receive VIMPAT and 0% (0/364) of patients randomized to receive placebo. In clinical trials in patients with diabetic neuropathy, asymptomatic first-degree AV block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.5% (5/1023) of patients receiving VIMPAT and 0% (0/291) of patients receiving placebo. Second degree or higher AV block has been reported in postmarketing experience in epilepsy patients. When VIMPAT is given with other drugs that prolong the PR interval, further PR prolongation is possible. Patients should be made aware of the symptoms of second-degree or higher AV block (e.g. slow or irregular pulse, feeling of lightheadedness and fainting) and told to contact their physician should any of these occur.



 VIMPAT should be used with caution in patients with known conduction problems (e.g. marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), or with severe cardiac disease such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning VIMPAT, and after VIMPAT is titrated to steady-state, is recommended.



    Atrial fibrillation and Atrial flutter



  In the short-term investigational trials of VIMPAT in epilepsy patients, there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter, however, both have been reported in open label epilepsy trials and in postmarketing experience. In patients with diabetic neuropathy, 0.5% of patients treated with VIMPAT experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. VIMPAT administration may predispose to atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or flutter), especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease. Patients should be made aware of the symptoms of atrial fibrillation and flutter (e.g., palpitations, rapid pulse, shortness of breath) and told to contact their physician should any of these symptoms occur.



    5.4 Syncope



  In the short-term controlled trials of VIMPAT in epilepsy patients with no significant system illnesses, there was no increase in syncope compared to placebo. In the short-term controlled trials of VIMPAT in patients with diabetic neuropathy, 1.2% of patients who were treated with VIMPAT reported an adverse reaction of syncope or loss of consciousness, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathy. Most of the cases of syncope were observed in patients receiving doses above 400 mg/day. The cause of syncope was not determined in most cases. However, several were associated with either changes in orthostatic blood pressure, atrial flutter/fibrillation (and associated tachycardia), or bradycardia.



    5.5 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)



  As with all AEDs, VIMPAT should be withdrawn gradually (over a minimum of 1 week) to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders.



    5.6 Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions



  One case of symptomatic hepatitis and nephritis was observed among 4011 subjects exposed to VIMPAT during clinical development. The event occurred in a healthy volunteer, 10 days after stopping VIMPAT treatment. The subject was not taking any concomitant medication and potential known viral etiologies for hepatitis were ruled out. The subject fully recovered within a month, without specific treatment. The case is consistent with a delayed multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction. Additional potential cases included 2 with rash and elevated liver enzymes and 1 with myocarditis and hepatitis of uncertain etiology.



 Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as D  rug R  eaction with E  osinophilia and S  ystemic S  ymptoms, or DRESS) have been reported with other anticonvulsants and typically, although not exclusively, present with fever and rash associated with other organ system involvement, that may or may not include eosinophilia, hepatitis, nephritis, lymphadenopathy, and/or myocarditis. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ system signs and symptoms not noted here may occur. If this reaction is suspected, VIMPAT should be discontinued and alternative treatment started.



    5.7 Phenylketonurics



  VIMPAT oral solution contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. A 200 mg dose of VIMPAT oral solution (equivalent to 20 mL) contains 0.32 mg of phenylalanine.
