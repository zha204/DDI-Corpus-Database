    6.1          Clinical Trial Experience  

  The following adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:



 *  Agranulocytosis/Neutropenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (    5.1    ) ] 
 *  Liver Enzyme Elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions (    5.3    ) ] 
 *  Zinc Deficiency [ see Warnings and Precautions (    5.4    ) ] 
    Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 

 Adverse reaction information for FERRIPROX represents the pooled data collected from 642 patients who participated in single arm or active-controlled clinical trials.



 The most serious adverse reaction reported in clinical trials with FERRIPROX was agranulocytosis [  see Warnings and Precautions (      5.1      )  ].



 The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials were chromaturia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, alanine aminotransferase increased, arthralgia and neutropenia.



 The table below lists the adverse drug reactions that occurred in at least 1% of patients treated with FERRIPROX in clinical trials.

     6.2          Postmarketing Experience

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: AGRANULOCYTOSIS/NEUTROPENIA

    WARNING: AGRANULOCYTOSIS    /NEUTROPENIA  

         FERRIPROX         can cause         agranulocytosis     that         can     lead to         serious     infections         and     death    .     Neutropenia may precede the development of agranulocytosis.     [see Warnings and Precautions (      5.1      )]  



        Measure the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) before starting     FERRIPROX     therapy and     monitor     the ANC     weekly         on     therapy    .         Interrupt     FERRIPROX         the    rapy         if     neutropenia         develops    .         [see Warnings and Precautions (      5.1      )]  



        Interrupt     FERRIPROX     if infection develops    ,     and monitor the         ANC     more frequently    .         [see Warnings and Precautions (      5.1      )]  



        Advise patients taking     FERRIPROX     to report immediately any symptoms indicative of infection.         [see Warnings and Precautions (      5.1      )]  



   EXCERPT:     WARNING: AGRANULOCYTOSIS/NEUTROPENIA  



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



        FERRIPROX can cause agranulocytosis that can lead to serious infections and death. Neutropenia may precede the development of agranulocytosis. (      5.1      )  



        Measure the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) before starting FERRIPROX and monitor the ANC weekly on therapy. (      5.1      )  



        Interrupt FERRIPROX if infection develops and monitor the ANC more frequently. (      5.1      )  



        Advise patients taking FERRIPROX to report immediately any symptoms indicative of infection. (      5.1      )  
</Section>
    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">     5         WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *  If infection occurs while on FERRIPROX, interrupt therapy and monitor the ANC more frequently. (  5.1  ) 
 *  FERRIPROX can cause fetal harm. Advise women of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid pregnancy while on this drug. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

    5.1         Agranulocytosis   /Neutropenia  



  Fatal agranulocytosis can occur with FERRIPROX use. FERRIPROX can also cause neutropenia, which may foreshadow agranulocytosis. Measure the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) before starting FERRIPROX therapy and monitor the ANC weekly on therapy.



 Interrupt FERRIPROX therapy if neutropenia develops (ANC &lt; 1.5 x 10  9  /L).



 Interrupt FERRIPROX if infection develops, and monitor the ANC frequently.



 Advise patients taking FERRIPROX to immediately interrupt therapy and report to their physician if they experience any symptoms indicative of infection.



 In pooled clinical trials, the incidence of agranulocytosis was 1.7% of patients. The mechanism of FERRIPROX-associated agranulocytosis is unknown. Agranulocytosis and neutropenia usually resolve upon discontinuation of FERRIPROX, but there have been reports of agranulocytosis leading to death.



 Implement a plan to monitor for and to manage agranulocytosis/neutropenia prior to initiating FERRIPROX treatment.



  For   neutropenia (   ANC   &lt; 1.5 x 10     9     /L and &gt; 0.5 x 10     9     /L):  



 Instruct the patient to immediately discontinue FERRIPROX and all other medications with a potential to cause neutropenia.



 Obtain a complete blood cell (CBC) count, including a white blood cell (WBC) count corrected for the presence of nucleated red blood cells, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and a platelet count daily until recovery (ANC &gt;= 1.5 x 10  9  /L).



  For   agranulocytosis (   ANC   &lt; 0.5 x 10     9     /L):  



 Consider hospitalization and other management as clinically appropriate.



 Do not resume FERRIPROX in patients who have developed agranulocytosis unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks. Do not rechallenge patients who develop neutropenia with FERRIPROX unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks.



     5.   2         Embryofetal   T   oxicity  



  Based on evidence of genotoxicity and developmental toxicity in animal studies, FERRIPROX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, administration of deferiprone during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death and malformations at doses lower than equivalent human clinical doses. If FERRIPROX is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking FERRIPROX, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy when taking FERRIPROX [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (     13.1     )  ].



     5.   3        L   iver Enzyme Elevations  



  In clinical studies, 7.5% of 642 subjects treated with FERRIPROX developed increased ALT values. Four (0.62%) FERRIPROX-treated subjects discontinued the drug due to increased serum ALT levels and 1 (0.16%) due to an increase in both ALT and AST.



 Monitor serum ALT values monthly during therapy with FERRIPROX, and consider interruption of therapy if there is a persistent increase in the serum transaminase levels.



     5.4        Zinc   Deficiency  



  Decreased plasma zinc concentrations have been observed on FERRIPROX therapy. Monitor plasma zinc, and supplement in the event of a deficiency.
