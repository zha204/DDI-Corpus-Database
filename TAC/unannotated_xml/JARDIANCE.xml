  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Pool of Placebo-Controlled Trials evaluating JARDIANCE 10 and 25 mg                            The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of four 24-week placebo-controlled trials and 18-week data from a placebo-controlled trial with insulin.  JARDIANCE was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in four trials  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  .



 These data reflect exposure of 1976 patients to JARDIANCE with a mean exposure duration of approximately 23 weeks.  Patients received placebo (N=995), JARDIANCE 10 mg (N=999), or JARDIANCE 25 mg (N=977) once daily.  The mean age of the population was 56 years and 3% were older than 75 years of age.  More than half (55%) of the population was male; 46% were White, 50% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American.  At baseline, 57% of the population had diabetes more than 5 years and had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8%.  Established microvascular complications of diabetes at baseline included diabetic nephropathy (7%), retinopathy (8%), or neuropathy (16%).  Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 91% of patients and moderately impaired in 9% of patients (mean eGFR 86.8 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ).



 Table 1 shows common adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) associated with the use of JARDIANCE.  The adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on JARDIANCE than on placebo and occurred in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with JARDIANCE 10 mg or JARDIANCE 25 mg.

          Thirst (including polydipsia) was reported in 0%, 1.7%, and 1.5% for placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively.
 

   Volume Depletion                            JARDIANCE causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion.  In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions related to volume depletion (e.g., blood pressure (ambulatory) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope) were reported by 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg respectively.  JARDIANCE may increase the risk of hypotension in patients at risk for volume contraction  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ,  8.6  )].  



   Increased Urination                            In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions of increased urination (e.g., polyuria, pollakiuria, and nocturia) occurred more frequently on JARDIANCE than on placebo (see Table 1).  Specifically, nocturia was reported by 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.8% of patients treated with placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively.



   Acute Impairment in Renal Function                            Treatment with JARDIANCE was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR (see Table 2).  Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline had larger mean changes  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.5,     8.6  )]  .



 In a long-term cardiovascular outcome trial, the acute impairment in renal function was observed to reverse after treatment discontinuation suggesting acute hemodynamic changes play a role in the renal function changes observed with empagliflozin.

             Hypoglycemia                            The incidence of hypoglycemia by study is shown in Table 3.  The incidence of hypoglycemia increased when JARDIANCE was administered with insulin or sulfonylurea  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )]  .

            Genital Mycotic Infections                            In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of genital mycotic infections (e.g., vaginal mycotic infection, vaginal infection, genital infection fungal, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and vulvitis) was increased in patients treated with JARDIANCE compared to placebo, occurring in 0.9%, 4.1%, and 3.7% of patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively.  Discontinuation from study due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with either JARDIANCE 10 or 25 mg.
 

 Genital mycotic infections occurred more frequently in female than male patients (see Table 1).



 Phimosis occurred more frequently in male patients treated with JARDIANCE 10 mg (less than 0.1%) and JARDIANCE 25 mg (0.1%) than placebo (0%).



   Urinary Tract Infections                            In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of urinary tract infections (e.g., urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and cystitis) was increased in patients treated with JARDIANCE compared to placebo (see Table 1).  Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections were more likely to experience a urinary tract infection.  The rate of treatment discontinuation due to urinary tract infections was 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.1% for placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively.



 Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients.  The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg was 16.6%, 18.4%, and 17.0%, respectively.  The incidence of urinary tract infections in male patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg was 3.2%, 3.6%, and 4.1%, respectively  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  )]  .



   Laboratory Tests    Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)                            Dose-related increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were observed in patients treated with JARDIANCE.  LDL-C increased by 2.3%, 4.6%, and 6.5% in patients treated with placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  )]  . The range of mean baseline LDL-C levels was 90.3 to 90.6 mg/dL across treatment groups.



   Increase in Hematocrit                            In a pool of four placebo-controlled studies, median hematocrit decreased by 1.3% in placebo and increased by 2.8% in JARDIANCE 10 mg and 2.8% in JARDIANCE 25 mg treated patients.  At the end of treatment, 0.6%, 2.7%, and 3.5% of patients with hematocrits initially within the reference range had values above the upper limit of the reference range with placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JARDIANCE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   EXCERPT:    *     Hypotension: Before initiating JARDIANCE assess and correct volume status in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy. (  5.1  ) 
 *     Ketoacidosis: Assess patients who present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis for ketoacidosis, regardless of blood glucose level. If suspected, discontinue JARDIANCE, evaluate and treat promptly. Before initiating JARDIANCE, consider risk factors for ketoacidosis. Patients on JARDIANCE may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation of therapy in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis. (  5.2  ) 
 *     Acute kidney injury and impairment in renal function: Consider temporarily discontinuing in settings of reduced oral intake or fluid losses. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue and promptly treat. Monitor renal function during therapy. (  5.3  ) 
 *     Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated (  5.4  ) 
 *     Hypoglycemia: Consider lowering the dose of insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when initiating JARDIANCE (  5.5  ) 
 *     Genital mycotic infections: Monitor and treat as appropriate (  5.6  ) 
 *     Increased LDL-C: Monitor and treat as appropriate (  5.7  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypotension



  JARDIANCE causes intravascular volume contraction.  Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating JARDIANCE [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  particularly in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics.  Before initiating JARDIANCE, assess for volume contraction and correct volume status if indicated.  Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy and increase monitoring in clinical situations where volume contraction is expected [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  )]  .



    5.2 Ketoacidosis



   Reports of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including JARDIANCE. Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking JARDIANCE. JARDIANCE is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (       1   )]     .  



  Patients treated with JARDIANCE who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels, as ketoacidosis associated with JARDIANCE may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg/dL. If ketoacidosis is suspected, JARDIANCE should be discontinued, patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin, fluid and carbohydrate replacement.                         



  In many of the postmarketing reports, and particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes, the presence of ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (often less than 250 mg/dL). Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. In some but not all cases, factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as insulin dose reduction, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake due to illness or surgery, pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g., type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse were identified.  



  Before initiating JARDIANCE, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause, caloric restriction, and alcohol abuse. In patients treated with JARDIANCE consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing JARDIANCE in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g., prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery).                         



    5.3 Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function



   JARDIANCE causes intravascular volume contraction [see Warnings and Precautions (       5.1   )]     and can cause renal impairment [see Adverse Reactions (       6.1   )]     . There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including JARDIANCE; some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age.  



  Before initiating JARDIANCE, consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury including hypovolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure and concomitant medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs). Consider temporarily discontinuing JARDIANCE in any setting of reduced oral intake (such as acute illness or fasting) or fluid losses (such as gastrointestinal illness or excessive heat exposure); monitor patients for signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue JARDIANCE promptly and institute treatment.  



  JARDIANCE increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR.  Patients with hypovolemia may be more susceptible to these changes.  Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating JARDIANCE [see Adverse Reactions (       6.1   )]     . Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of JARDIANCE and monitored periodically thereafter. More frequent renal function monitoring is recommended in patients with an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  . Use of JARDIANCE is not recommended when eGFR is persistently less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m  2  and is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m  2    [see Dosage and Administration (       2.2   ), Contraindications (    4   ), Use in Specific Populations (    8.6   )]     .  



    5.4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis



  There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including JARDIANCE. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (  6  )]  .



    5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues



  Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia.  The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when JARDIANCE is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JARDIANCE.



    5.6 Genital Mycotic Infections



  JARDIANCE increases the risk for genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .  Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop mycotic genital infections.  Monitor and treat as appropriate.



    5.7 Increased Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)



  Increases in LDL-C can occur with JARDIANCE [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Monitor and treat as appropriate.
