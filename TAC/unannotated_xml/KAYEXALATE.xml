Also, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia and significant sodium retention, and their related clinical manifestations, may occur (see  WARNINGS  ). Occasionally diarrhea develops. Large doses in elderly individuals may cause fecal impaction (see  PRECAUTIONS  ). Rare instances of intestinal necrosis have been reported. Intestinal obstruction due to concretions of aluminum hydroxide, when used in combination with KAYEXALATE, has been reported.
