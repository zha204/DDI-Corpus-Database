  EXCERPT:   In clinical trials, the most common (incidence &gt;=2% and greater than placebo) adverse reactions with WELCHOL included constipation, dyspepsia, and nausea.



 Postmarketing reports with concomitant WELCHOL administration include:



 *  Increased seizure activity or decreased phenytoin levels in patients receiving phenytoin. Administer phenytoin 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. 
 *  Reduced International Normalized Ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin. Monitor INR. 
 *  Elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in patients receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Administer thyroid hormones 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. 
    Other postmarketing reports include bowel obstruction, dysphagia, esophageal obstruction, fecal impaction, hypertriglyceridemia, pancreatitis, and increased transaminases (  5.5  ,  6.2  ,  7  ,  12.3  ).

  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Primary Hyperlipidemia:  In 7 double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials, 807 patients with primary hyperlipidemia (age range 18-86 years, 50% women, 90% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 2% Hispanics, 1% Asians) and elevated LDL-C were treated with WELCHOL 1.5 g/day to 4.5 g/day from 4 to 24 weeks (total exposure 199 patient-years).



 In clinical trials for the reduction of LDL-C, 68% of patients receiving WELCHOL vs. 64% of patients receiving placebo reported an adverse reaction.

      The reported adverse reactions during the additional 18-week open-label treatment period with WELCHOL 3.8 g per day were similar to those during the double-blind period and included headache (7.6%), nasopharyngitis (5.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.9%), influenza (3.8%), and nausea (3.8%)  [See Clinical Studies (  14.1  )].  
 

   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:  The safety of WELCHOL in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in 5 add-on combination and 1 monotherapy double-blind, 12-26 week, placebo-controlled clinical trials [  see Clinical Studies (  14.2  )].  In these studies 1022 patients were exposed to WELCHOL. The mean exposure duration was 20 weeks (total exposure 393 patient-years). Patients were to receive 3.8 grams of WELCHOL per day. The mean age of patients exposed to WELCHOL was 55.7 years, 52.8 percent of the population was male and 61.9% were Caucasian, 4.8% were Asian, and 15.9% were Black or African American. At baseline the population had a mean HbA1C of 8.2% and 26% had past medical history suggestive of microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline characteristics in the placebo group were comparable.



 In clinical trials of type 2 diabetes, 57% of patients receiving WELCHOL vs. 52% of patients receiving placebo reported an adverse reaction.



 Table 3 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of WELCHOL in the 1015 patients with type 2 diabetes. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on WELCHOL than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with WELCHOL.

 Back Pain                  23 (2.3)                   13 (1.3)                    
      A total of 5.3% of WELCHOL-treated patients and 3.6% of placebo-treated patients were discontinued from the diabetes trials due to adverse reactions. This difference was driven mostly by gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as abdominal pain and constipation.
 

 One patient in the add-on to sulfonylurea trial discontinued due to body rash and mouth blistering that occurred on the first day of dosing of WELCHOL, which may represent a hypersensitivity reaction to WELCHOL.



   Hypertriglyceridemia  : Patients with fasting serum TG levels above 500 mg/dL were excluded from the diabetes clinical trials. In the diabetes trials, 1292 (67.7%) patients had baseline fasting serum TG levels less than 200 mg/dL, 426 (22.3%) had baseline fasting serum TG levels between 200 and less than 300 mg/dL, 175 (9.2%) had baseline fasting serum TG levels between 300 and 500 mg/dL, and 16 (0.8%) had fasting serum TG levels greater than or equal to 500 mg/dL. The median baseline fasting TG concentration for the study population was 160 mg/dL; the median post-treatment fasting TG was 180 mg/dL in the WELCHOL group and 162 mg/dL in the placebo group. WELCHOL therapy resulted in a median placebo-corrected increase in serum TG of 9.7% (p=0.03) in the monotherapy study and of 5% (p=0.22), 11% (p&lt;0.001), 18% (p&lt;0.001), and 22% (p&lt;0.001), when added to metformin, pioglitazone, sulfonylureas, and insulin, respectively  [See Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ) and Clinical Studies (  14.2  )]  . In comparison, WELCHOL resulted in a median increase in serum TG of 5% compared to placebo (p=0.42) in a 24-week monotherapy lipid-lowering trial  [See Clinical Studies (  14.1  )].  



 Treatment-emergent fasting TG concentrations &gt;=500 mg/dL occurred in 0.9% of WELCHOL-treated patients compared to 0.7% of placebo-treated patients in the diabetes trials. Among these patients, the TG concentrations with WELCHOL (median 606 mg/dL; interquartile range 570-794 mg/dL) were similar to that observed with placebo (median 663 mg/dL; interquartile range 542-984 mg/dL). Five (0.6%) patients on WELCHOL and 3 (0.3%) patients on placebo developed TG elevations &gt;=1000 mg/dL. In all WELCHOL clinical trials, including studies in patients with type 2 diabetes and patients with primary hyperlipidemia, there were no reported cases of acute pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia. It is unknown whether patients with more uncontrolled, baseline hypertriglyceridemia would have greater increases in serum TG levels with WELCHOL  [See Contraindications (  4  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].  



   Cardiovascular adverse events:  During the diabetes clinical trials, the incidence of patients with treatment-emergent serious adverse events involving the cardiovascular system was 2.2% (22/1015) in the WELCHOL group and 1% (10/1010) in the placebo group. These overall rates included disparate events (e.g., myocardial infarction, aortic stenosis, and bradycardia); therefore, the significance of this imbalance is unknown.



   6.2 Post-marketing Experience

  The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of WELCHOL. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *     *  Increased seizure activity or decreased phenytoin levels in patients receiving phenytoin. Phenytoin should be administered 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. 
 *  Reduced International Normalized Ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin therapy. In warfarin-treated patients, INR should be monitored frequently during WELCHOL initiation then periodically thereafter. 
 *  Elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in patients receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Thyroid hormone replacement should be administered 4 hours prior to WELCHOL [See Drug Interactions (  7  )].  
    Drug Interactions with concomitant WELCHOL administration include:  
 *      Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Bowel obstruction (in patients with a history of bowel obstruction or resection), dysphagia (tablet and oral suspension formulations) or esophageal obstruction (occasionally requiring medical intervention), fecal impaction, pancreatitis, abdominal distension, exacerbation of hemorrhoids, and increased transaminases. 
 *      Laboratory Abnormalities Hypertriglyceridemia

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  The effect of WELCHOL on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined (  5.1  ). 
 *  WELCHOL can increase TG, particularly when used with insulin or sulfonylureas. Marked hypertriglyceridemia can cause acute pancreatitis. The effect of hypertriglyceridemia on the risk of coronary artery disease is uncertain. Monitor lipids, including TG and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) (  5.2  ). 
 *  Bile acid sequestrants may decrease absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Use caution in patients susceptible to fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (  5.3  ). 
 *  Because of its constipating effects, WELCHOL is not recommended in patients at risk of bowel obstruction (e.g., patients with gastroparesis, other gastrointestinal motility disorders or a history of major gastrointestinal surgery) (  5.4  ). 
 *  WELCHOL reduces gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs. Administer drugs with a known interaction with colesevelam at least 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. Drugs that have not been tested for interaction with colesevelam, especially those with a narrow therapeutic index, should also be administered at least 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. Alternatively, monitor drug levels of the co-administered drug (  5.5  ,  7  ,  12.3  ). 
 *  WELCHOL for Oral Suspension contains 13.5 mg phenylalanine per 1.875 gram packet and 27 mg phenylalanine per 3.75 gram packet (  5.6  ,  11  ). 
    
 

   5.1 General



  The effect of WELCHOL on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.



    5.2 Serum Triglycerides



  WELCHOL, like other bile acid sequestrants, can increase serum TG concentrations.



 WELCHOL had small effects on serum TG (median increase 5% compared to placebo) in trials of patients with primary hyperlipidemia [See Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ) and Clinical Studies (  14.1  )].  



 In clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, greater increases in TG levels occurred when WELCHOL was used as monotherapy (median increase 9.7% compared to placebo) and when WELCHOL was used in combination with pioglitazone (median increase 11% compared to placebo in combination with pioglitazone), sulfonylureas (median increase 18% compared to placebo in combination with sulfonylureas), and insulin (median increase 22% compared to placebo in combination with insulin) [See Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ) and Clinical Studies (  14.2  )].  Hypertriglyceridemia of sufficient severity can cause acute pancreatitis. The long-term effect of hypertriglyceridemia on the risk of coronary artery disease is uncertain. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the effect of WELCHOL on LDL-C levels may be attenuated by WELCHOL's effects on TG levels and a smaller reduction in non HDL-C compared to the reduction in LDL-C. Caution should be exercised when treating patients with TG levels greater than 300 mg/dL. Because most patients in the WELCHOL clinical trials had baseline TG &lt;300 mg/dL, it is unknown whether patients with more uncontrolled baseline hypertriglyceridemia would have greater increases in serum TG levels with WELCHOL. In addition, the use of WELCHOL is contraindicated in patients with TG levels &gt;500 mg/dL [See Contraindications (  4  )]  . Lipid parameters, including TG levels and non-HDL-C, should be obtained before starting WELCHOL and periodically thereafter. WELCHOL should be discontinued if TG levels exceed 500 mg/dL or if the patient develops hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [See Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  



    5.3 Vitamin K or Fat-Soluble Vitamin Deficiencies Precautions



  Bile acid sequestrants may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. No specific clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of WELCHOL on the absorption of co-administered dietary or supplemental vitamin therapy. In non-clinical safety studies, rats administered colesevelam hydrochloride at doses greater than 30-fold the projected human clinical dose experienced hemorrhage from vitamin K deficiency. Patients on oral vitamin supplementation should take their vitamins at least 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. Caution should be exercised when treating patients with a susceptibility to deficiencies of vitamin K (e.g., patients on warfarin, patients with malabsorption syndromes) or other fat-soluble vitamins.



    5.4 Gastrointestinal Disorders



  Because of its constipating effects, WELCHOL is not recommended in patients with gastroparesis, other gastrointestinal motility disorders, and in those who have had major gastrointestinal tract surgery and who may be at risk for bowel obstruction. Because of the tablet size, WELCHOL Tablets can cause dysphagia or esophageal obstruction and should be used with caution in patients with dysphagia or swallowing disorders. To avoid esophageal distress, WELCHOL for Oral Suspension should not be taken in its dry form. Always mix WELCHOL for Oral Suspension with water, fruit juice, or diet soft drinks before ingesting.



    5.5 Drug Interactions



  WELCHOL reduces gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs. Drugs with a known interaction with colesevelam should be administered at least 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. Drugs that have not been tested for interaction with colesevelam, especially those with a narrow therapeutic index, should also be administered at least 4 hours prior to WELCHOL. Alternatively, the physician should monitor drug levels of the co-administered drug [See Drug Interactions (  7  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  



     5.6 Phenylketonurics  



   WELCHOL for Oral Suspension contains 13.5 mg phenylalanine per 1.875 gram packet and 27 mg phenylalanine per 3.75 gram packet [See Description (  11  )].    



    5.7 Macrovascular Outcomes



  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular disease risk reduction with WELCHOL or any other antidiabetic drugs.
