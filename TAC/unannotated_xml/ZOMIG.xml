  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adults    



 Among 460 patients treating 1180 single attacks with ZOMIG nasal spray in a blinded placebo-controlled trial (Study 1), there was a low withdrawal rate related to adverse reactions: 5 mg (1.3%), 2.5 mg (0%), and placebo (0.4%). None of the withdrawals were due to a serious event. One patient was withdrawn due to abnormal ECG changes from baseline that were incidentally found 23 days after the last dose of ZOMIG nasal spray.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=5% and &gt; placebo) in any dosage strength in clinical trials for ZOMIG nasal spray were: unusual taste, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, and dizziness. The incidence of adverse reactions was generally dose-related.



 Table 1 lists the adverse reactions from the controlled clinical trial (Study 1) that occurred in &gt;=2% of patients in either the 2.5 or 5 mg ZOMIG nasal spray dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo.

          In Study 1, adverse reactions occurring in &gt;=1% and &lt; 2% of patients in all attacks in either ZOMIG nasal spray dose group and with incidence greater than that of placebo were: abdominal pain, chills, throat pressure, facial edema, chest pressure, palpitation, dysphagia, arthralgia, myalgia, and depersonalization.
 

 The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, weight, or age of the patients (18-39 vs. 40-65 years of age), or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions.



   Local Adverse Reactions:  



 Among 460 patients using ZOMIG 2.5 mg or 5 mg in the controlled clinical trial, approximately 3% noted local irritation or soreness at the site of administration. Adverse reactions of any kind, perceived in the nasopharynx (which may include systemic effects of triptans) were severe in about 1% of patients and approximately 57% resolved in 1 hour. Nasopharyngeal examinations, in a subset of patients participating in two long term trials of up to one year duration, failed to demonstrate any clinically significant changes with repeated use of ZOMIG nasal spray.



 All nasopharyngeal adverse reactions with an incidence of &gt;= 2% of patients in any ZOMIG nasal spray dose groups are included in Table 1.



   Other Adverse Reactions:  



 In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of ZOMIG in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Reaction frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used ZOMIG nasal spray and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to ZOMIG nasal spray (n=3059). All reported reactions are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients and rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.



   General:  Infrequent: allergic reactions.



   Cardiovascular:  Infrequent: arrhythmias, hypertension, syncope and tachycardia. Rare: angina pectoris and myocardial infarct.



   Digestive:  Rare: stomatitis.



   Neurological:  Infrequent: agitation, amnesia, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and nervousness. Rare: convulsions.



   Respiratory:  Infrequent: bronchitis, increased cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, laryngeal edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and sinusitis.



   Skin:  Infrequent: pruritus, rash, and urticaria.



   Urogenital:  Infrequent: polyuria and urinary urgency. Rare: urinary frequency.



   Special senses:  Infrequent: tinnitus. Rare: conjunctivitis, dry eye, and visual field defect.



 The adverse reaction profile seen with ZOMIG nasal spray is similar to that seen with ZOMIG tablets and ZOMIG-ZMT tablets except for the occurrence of local adverse reactions from the nasal spray (see  ZOMIG tablet/ZOMIG  -  ZMT oral disintegrating tablet Prescribing Information  ).



     Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age    



 The safety of ZOMIG nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two studies [  see Pediatric Use  (8.4)  and Clinical Studies      (14.2)].    



 The most common adverse reactions (incidence of &gt;=2% of pediatric patients receiving 2.5 mg and 5 mg ZOMIG nasal spray and numerically greater than placebo) after a single dose are summarized in Table 2. Dysgeusia (unusual taste) was the most common adverse reaction, with a numerically greater incidence for patients receiving ZOMIG compared to placebo (10% vs. 2%). Other common adverse reactions were nasal discomfort, dizziness, oropharyngeal pain, and nausea.



 Table 2 lists the adverse reactions from the pooled placebo-controlled studies that occurred in &gt;= 2% of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in either the 2.5 mg or 5 mg ZOMIG dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo.

          The adverse reaction profile was similar across gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions.
 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of ZOMIG. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section.



   Hypersensitivity Reactions:  



 There have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving ZOMIG. ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to ZOMIG.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors  (5.1)   
 *    Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs  (5.2)   
 *    Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk  (5.3)   
 *    Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs  (5.4)   
 *    Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs  (5.5)   
 *    Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary  (5.6)   
 *    Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs (  5.7  ,  7.5  ) 
 *    Increase in blood pressure: very rarely associated with significant events  (5.8)   
    
 

   5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina



  ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of ZOMIG. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1agonists including ZOMIG may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.



 Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving ZOMIG. Do not administer ZOMIG if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [ see Contraindications  (4)    ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first ZOMIG dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following ZOMIG administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of ZOMIG.



    5.2 Arrhythmias



  Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1agonists. Discontinue ZOMIG if these disturbances occur. Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders should not receive ZOMIG [ see Contraindications  (4)    ] .  



    5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure



  As with other 5-HT1agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with ZOMIG and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT1agonists [ see Contraindications  (4)    ].



    5.4 Cerebrovascular Events



  Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Discontinue ZOMIG if a cerebrovascular event occurs.



 As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions should be excluded. ZOMIG should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [ see Contraindications  (4)    ].



    5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions



  5-HT1agonists, including ZOMIG, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional ZOMIG doses [ see Contraindications  (4)    ].



 Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1agonists have not been clearly established.



    5.6 Medication Overuse Headache



  Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.



    5.7 Serotonin Syndrome



  Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including ZOMIG, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions  (7.5)    ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. ZOMIG treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [ see Drug Interactions  (7.5)  and Patient Counseling Information  (17)    ] .  



    5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure



  Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists including patients without a history of hypertension. Very rarely these increases in blood pressure have been associated with significant clinical events. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of ZOMIG oral tablet, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of ZOMIG oral tablet. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in ZOMIG-treated patients. ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [ see Contraindications  (4)    ].
