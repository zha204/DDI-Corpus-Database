  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rate observed in practice.



     Adults  



 Overall, in 6 placebo-controlled clinical trials, 1,038 adults 18 through 65 years of age received at least one dose of ORALAIR 300IR, of whom 611 (59%) completed at least four months of therapy. Of study participants, 56% were male, 17% had a history of mild intermittent asthma at study entry, and 64% were polysensitized. Data on race and ethnicity were not systematically captured in the five European studies (N=805). In the US study (N=233), a limited number of patients reported their race as other than White/Caucasian (Black/African American: 5.6%, Asian: 2.6%, Other: 2.1%) or their ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino (3.0%). Adverse events were captured on a daily diary card that did not solicit for specific adverse events.



 Across the six clinical studies, adverse reactions reported at an incidence of &gt;=2% of ORALAIR recipients and at a greater incidence than that in participants treated with placebo are listed in Table 2.

             Serious Adverse Reactions  
 

 At least 1 serious adverse event was reported in 22 of 1514 (1.5%) subjects who received ORALAIR at any dose, and 11 of 840 (1.1%) of placebo recipients. Of the 22 serious adverse events in the ORALAIR recipients, 2 were considered "definitely related" to ORALAIR.



 *     The first subject was an adult who experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction which began 5 minutes after administration of ORALAIR. The symptoms were violent coughing and marked dyspnea. The subject was treated with antihistamines, salbutamol and prednisolone and the reaction resolved without sequelae. 
 *     The second subject was an adult who experienced severe laryngeal edema. The subject was treated with prednisolone and event resolved without sequelae. 
    There was also one case of gastroenteritis with an onset on Day 93 of therapy that was possibly related to ORALAIR.
 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

    Post Marketing Safety Studies  



 A total of 1728 individuals (808 adults; 920 children 5 through 17 years of age) received ORALAIR in post marketing safety studies. Reported adverse reactions included: anaphylactic reaction, oral allergy syndrome, flushing, dyspnea, laryngeal edema, and diarrhea.



     Spontaneous Postmarketing Reports  



 In addition to adverse reactions reported in clinical and post marketing safety studies, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ORALAIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: autoimmune thyroiditis, eosinophilic myocarditis, eosinophilic esophagitis, palpitations, tachycardia, hypotension, loss of consciousness, circulatory collapse, malaise, pallor, peripheral vascular disorder, stridor, angioedema, face edema, weight decreased, wheezing, exacerbation of asthma, chest discomfort, oropharyngeal paresthesia, oropharyngeal blistering, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, asthenia, somnolence, anxiety, rash, pruritus, salivary gland enlargement and/or hypersecretion, dry mouth, dry eye, influenza-like syndrome, lymphadenopathy, eosinophil count increased.

</Section>
    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instruct them to seek immediate medical care and discontinue therapy should any of these occur. (  5.1  ) 
 *  In case of oral inflammation or wounds, stop treatment with ORALAIR to allow complete healing of the oral cavity. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Severe Allergic Reactions



  ORALAIR can cause systemic allergic reactions including anaphylaxis which may be life-threatening. In addition, ORALAIR can cause severe local reactions, including laryngopharyngeal swelling, which can compromise breathing and be life-threatening.



 Patients who have a systemic allergic reaction to ORALAIR should stop taking ORALAIR.



 Patients who have either escalating or persistent local reactions to ORALAIR should be reevaluated and considered for discontinuation of ORALAIR.



 Administer the initial dose of ORALAIR in a healthcare setting under the supervision of a physician prepared to manage a severe systemic or a severe local allergic reaction. Observe patients in the office for at least 30 minutes following the initial dose of ORALAIR.



 Severe and serious allergic reactions may require treatment with epinephrine [ See  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ].



    5.2 Epinephrine



  Prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine to patients receiving ORALAIR. Instruct patients to recognize the signs and symptoms of a severe allergic reaction and in the proper use of emergency self-injection of epinephrine, and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care upon its use [ See  Patient Counseling Information (17)    ].



 ORALAIR may not be suitable for patients with certain medical conditions that may reduce the ability to survive a serious allergic reaction or increase the risk of adverse reactions after epinephrine administration. Examples of these medical conditions include but are not limited to: markedly compromised lung function (either chronic or acute), unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, significant arrhythmia, and uncontrolled hypertension.



 ORALAIR may not be suitable for patients who are taking medications that can potentiate or inhibit the effect of epinephrine. These medications include:



 *      Betaeta-adrenergic blockers : Patients taking beta-adrenergic blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat serious systemic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Specifically, beta-adrenergic blockers antagonize the cardiostimulating and bronchodilating effects of epinephrine. 
 *      Alpha-adrenergic blockers, ergot alkaloids : Patients taking alpha-adrenergic blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat serious systemic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Specifically, alpha-adrenergic blockers antagonize the vasoconstricting and hypertensive effects of epinephrine. Similarly, ergot alkaloids may reverse the pressor effects of epinephrine. 
 *      Tricyclic antidepressants, levothyroxine sodium, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and certain antihistamines : The adverse effects of epinephrine may be potentiated in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants, levothyroxine sodium, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and the antihistamines chlorpheniramine, and diphenhydramine. 
 *      Cardiac glycosides, diuretics : Patients who receive epinephrine while taking cardiac glycosides or diuretics should be observed carefully for the development of cardiac arrhythmias. 
       5.3 Eosinophilic Esophagitis
 

   Eosinophilic esophagitis has been reported in association with sublingual tablet immunotherapy [ see  Contraindications (4)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ]. Discontinue ORALAIR and consider a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis in patients who experience severe or persistent gastro-esophageal symptoms including dysphagia or chest pain.  



    5.4 Asthma



  ORALAIR has not been studied in subjects with moderate or severe asthma or any subjects who required daily medication.



 Immunotherapy with ORALAIR should be withheld if the patient is experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation. Reevaluate patients who have recurrent asthma exacerbations and consider discontinuation of ORALAIR.



    5.5 Concomitant Allergen Immunotherapy



  ORALAIR has not been studied in subjects receiving concomitant allergen immunotherapy. Concomitant dosing with other allergen immunotherapy may increase the likelihood of local or systemic adverse reactions to either subcutaneous or sublingual allergen immunotherapy.



    5.6 Oral Inflammation



  Stop treatment with ORALAIR to allow complete healing of the oral cavity in patients with oral inflammation (e.g., oral lichen planus, mouth ulcers or thrush) or oral wounds, such as those following oral surgery or dental extraction.



    5.7 Initiation of ORALAIR Therapy during Grass Pollen Season



  The risk of ORALAIR may be increased when treatment is initiated during the grass pollen season.
