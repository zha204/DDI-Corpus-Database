  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   EXCERPT:   The most common ocular adverse reactions, occurring in less than 4% of eyes treated with LASTACAFT  (r)  , were eye irritation, burning and/or stinging on instillation, eye redness, and eye pruritus. (  6.1  )



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Allergan at 1-800-433-8871 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or    www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  The most frequent ocular adverse reactions, occurring in less than 4% of eyes treated with LASTACAFT  (r)  , were eye irritation, burning and/or stinging upon instillation, eye redness and eye pruritus.



   6.2 Non-ocular Adverse Reactions

  The most frequent non-ocular adverse reactions, occurring in less than 3% of subjects with eyes treated with LASTACAFT  (r)  , were nasopharyngitis and headache. Some of these events were similar to the underlying disease being studied.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of LASTACAFT  (r)  in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions include: eye discharge, eye swelling, erythema of eyelid, eyelid edema, hypersensitivity, and somnolence.
