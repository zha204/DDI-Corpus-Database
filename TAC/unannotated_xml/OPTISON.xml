  Clinical Trials Experience

  OPTISON was administered in clinical studies in 279 patients. Of these patients there were 192 (68.8%) men and 87 (31.2%) women. The racial demographics were 199 (71.3%) Caucasian, 52 (18.6%) Black, 24 (8.6%) Hispanic, and 4 (1.4%) other racial or ethnic groups.



 In these patients, 47 (16.8%) reported at least one adverse event. Of these one event was serious and required treatment with antihistamines for hypersensitivity manifestations of dizziness, nausea, flushing and temperature elevation. Deaths were not reported during the clinical studies.



 Of the reported adverse reactions following the use of OPTISON the most frequently reported were headache (5.4%), nausea and/or vomiting (4.3%), warm sensation or flushing (3.6%), and dizziness (2.5%). The most common adverse events observed in clinical studies of OPTISON are given in Table 4.

         Adverse events reported in &lt; 0.5% of subjects who received OPTISON included: arthralgia, back pain, body or muscle aches, induration, urticaria, dry mouth, eosinophilia, palpitations, paresthesia, photophobia, premature ventricular contraction, pruritus, rash, irritableness, hypersensitivity, tinnitus, tremor, visual blurring, wheezing, oxygen saturation decline due to coughing, discoloration at the Heplock site, and burning sensation in the eyes.
 

 Overall the reported adverse events with OPTISON were similar in type and frequency to those reported in the 199 patients who received ALBUNEX  (r)  .



 In the clinical dose ranging studies of 40 normal volunteers, doses higher than those recommended in the  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  section tended to be associated with an increased frequency of reported adverse events.



   Postmarketing Experience

  In a prospective, post-marketing safety surveillance study of OPTISON used in routine clinical practice, a total of 1039 subjects received OPTISON. Of these patients, 648 (62.4%) were male and 391 (37.6%) were female with average age of 59.9 years (min, max: 20, 97). The racial distributions were 864 (83.2%) White, 141 (13.6%) Black, 18 (1.7%) Asian, and 16 (1.5%) other racial or ethnic groups. Overall, 175 patients (16.8%) reported at least one adverse event. No serious adverse reactions, including deaths, were reported in this study, suggesting that these reactions are unlikely to occur at a rate of more than 0.3% when OPTISON is used according to recommendations.



 The following adverse reactions have been identified during the postmarketing use of OPTISON. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Cardiac arrests and other serious but non-fatal adverse reactions were uncommonly reported. Most of these uncommon reactions included cardiopulmonary symptoms and signs such as cardiac arrest, hypotension, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, respiratory distress or decreased oxygenation. Reports also identified neurologic reactions (loss of consciousness or convulsions) as well as anaphylactoid reactions (see  WARNINGS  ).

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: SERIOUS CARDIOPULMONARY REACTIONS

    WARNING: SERIOUS CARDIOPULMONARY REACTIONS  

    Serious cardiopulmonary reactions, including fatalities, have occurred uncommonly during or following perflutren-containing microsphere administration.  Most serious reactions occur within 30 minutes of administration (see   WARNINGS   and   PRECAUTIONS  ).  



 *  Assess all patients for the presence of any condition that precludes OPTISON administration (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). 
 *  Always have resuscitation equipment and trained personnel readily available.
