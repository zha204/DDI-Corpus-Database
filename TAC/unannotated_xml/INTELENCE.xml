  The following adverse reactions are described in greater detail in other sections:



 *  Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)   ]. 
      EXCERPT:   The most common adverse drug reactions of moderate to severe intensity (&gt;= 2%) which occurred at a higher rate than placebo are rash and peripheral neuropathy. (  6  )
 

  



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Tibotec Therapeutics at 1-877-REACH-TT or 1-877-732-2488 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch  .  



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety assessment is based on all data from 1203 subjects in the Phase 3 placebo-controlled trials, TMC125-C206 and TMC125-C216, conducted in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected adult subjects, 599 of whom received INTELENCE  (r)  (200 mg b.i.d.). In these pooled trials, the median exposure for subjects in the INTELENCE  (r)  arm and placebo arm was 52.3 and 51.0 weeks, respectively. Discontinuations due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were 5.2% in the INTELENCE  (r)  arm and 2.6% in the placebo arm.



 The most frequently reported ADR at least Grade 2 in severity was rash (10.0%). Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug hypersensitivity reaction and erythema multiforme were reported in &lt; 0.1% of subjects during clinical development with INTELENCE  (r)  [  see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ]. A total of 2.2% of HIV-1-infected subjects in Phase 3 trials receiving INTELENCE  (r)  discontinued due to rash. In general, in clinical trials, rash was mild to moderate, occurred primarily in the second week of therapy, and was infrequent after Week 4. Rash generally resolved within 1-2 weeks on continued therapy. The incidence of rash was higher in women compared to men in the INTELENCE  (r)  arm in the Phase 3 trials. Patients with a history of NNRTI-related rash did not appear to be at increased risk for the development of INTELENCE  (r)  -related rash compared to patients without a history of NNRTI-related rash.



   

    Common Adverse Reactions  



 Clinical ADRs of moderate intensity or greater (&gt;= Grade 2) and reported in &gt;= 2% of subjects treated with INTELENCE  (r)  and occurring at a higher rate compared to placebo (excess of 1%) are presented in Table 1. Laboratory abnormalities considered ADRs are included in Table 2.



 Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse ReactionsIncludes adverse reactions at least possibly, probably, or very likely related to the drug. of at least Moderate IntensityIntensities are defined as follows: Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity). (Grades 2-4) in &gt;= 2% of Adult Subjects in the INTELENCE(r) Treatment Groups and at a higher rate compared to placebo (excess of 1%)

     Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus  



 In Phase 3 trials TMC125-C206 and TMC125-C216, 139 subjects (12.3%) with chronic hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection out of 1129 subjects were permitted to enroll. AST and ALT abnormalities occurred more frequently in hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infected subjects for both treatment groups. Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 27.8%, 25.0% and 7.1% respectively, of INTELENCE  (r)  -treated co-infected subjects as compared to 6.7%, 7.5% and 1.8% of non-co-infected INTELENCE  (r)  -treated subjects. In general, adverse events reported by INTELENCE  (r)  -treated subjects with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection were similar to INTELENCE  (r)  -treated subjects without hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following events have been identified during postmarketing use of INTELENCE  (r)  . Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Fatal cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported. Severe hypersensitivity reactions including cases of hepatic failure have been reported [  see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ].

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



  EXCERPT:   Severe, potentially life threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme. Immediately discontinue treatment if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash or rash with systemic symptoms or liver transaminase elevations develops and monitor clinical status, including liver transaminases closely. (  5.1  )



 



   5.1 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions



   Severe, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported. These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. In Phase 3 clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 1.3% of subjects receiving INTELENCE  (r)  compared to 0.2% of placebo subjects. A total of 2.2% of HIV-1-infected subjects receiving INTELENCE  (r)  discontinued from Phase 3 trials due to rash [ see  Adverse Reactions (6)    ]. Rash occurred most commonly during the first 6 weeks of therapy.  



  Discontinue INTELENCE  (r)  immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver transaminases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping INTELENCE  (r)  treatment after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.  



    5.2 Fat Redistribution



  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.



    5.3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including INTELENCE  (r)  . During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  complex, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia, and tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.
