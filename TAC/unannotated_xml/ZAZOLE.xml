  During controlled clinical studies conducted in the United States, patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis were treated with terconazole vaginal cream 0.8% for 3 days. Based on comparative analyses with placebo and a standard agent, the adverse experiences considered most likely related to terconazole vaginal cream 0.8% were headache (21% vs 16% with placebo) and dysmenorrhea (6% vs 2% with placebo). Genital complaints in general, and burning and itching in particular, occurred less frequently in the terconazole vaginal cream 0.8% 3 day regimen (5% vs. 6%-9% with placebo). Other adverse experiences reported with terconazole vaginal cream 0.8% were abdominal pain (3.4% vs. 1% with placebo) and fever (1% vs. 0.3% with placebo). The therapy-related dropout rate was 2.0% for the terconazole vaginal cream 0.8%. The adverse drug experience most frequently causing discontinuation of therapy was vulvovaginal itching, 0.7% with the terconazole vaginal cream 0.8% group and 0.3% with the placebo group.
