   The most serious adverse reactions to treatment with WILATE in patients with VWD were hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].  



   EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 1%) in clinical studies on VWD were hypersensitivity reactions, urticaria, and dizziness (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during these trials cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 A total of 157 VWD subjects (aged 1 to 83 years) received WILATE on 6769 occasions, including clinical studies that involved prophylactic use, treatment on demand, surgery, and pharmacokinetics. Of the 157 subjects, 32 (20.4%) had VWD type 1, 42 (26.8%) had VWD type 2, and 83 (52.9%) had VWD type 3; 96 (61.1%) subjects were female and 61 (38.9%) subjects were male. Overall, subjects received 11,222,241 IU of WILATE during 6355 exposure days. The most common adverse reactions were hypersensitivity reactions (3 subjects; 1.9%), urticaria and dizziness (each with 2 subjects; 1.3%). Five subjects (3.2%) showed seroconversion for antibodies to parvovirus B19 not accompanied by clinical signs of disease. Seroconversion for parvovirus B19 DNA has not been reported since implementation of minipool testing of plasma used for the manufacture of WILATE.



   Immunogenicity  



 The immunogenicity of WILATE was specifically assessed in 97 subjects in 3 clinical studies in which subjects received 9,635,041 IU of WILATE during 5575 exposure days. No inhibitors of VWF were detected in these 3 studies. In one of 3 studies, which also assessed FVIII inhibitor development in 15 subjects, no inhibitors of FVIII were detected after administration of a total of 223,290 IU of WILATE over 419 administrations.



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to WILATE with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of WILATE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure.



 Post-marketing adverse reactions reported in patients treated with WILATE include, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, rash, headache, tachycardia, flushing, hypotension, chills, cough, chest discomfort, abdominal pain, pyrexia, factor VIII inhibition, anaphylactic reaction and paresthesia.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



    EXCERPT:   Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions are possible (  5.1  ).



 Thromboembolic events may occur. Monitor plasma levels of FVIII activity (  5.2  ).



 Development of neutralizing antibodies to FVIII and to VWF, especially in VWD type 3 patients, may occur (  5.3  ).



 WILATE is made from human plasma and carries the risk of transmitting infectious agents (  5.4  ).



 



   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions may occur with WILATE. Signs and symptoms include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalized urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, and wheezing that may progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock) with or without fever.[  3  ] Closely monitor patients receiving WILATE and observe for any symptoms throughout the infusion period.



 Because inhibitor antibodies may occur concomitantly with anaphylactic reactions, evaluate patients experiencing an anaphylactic reaction for the presence of inhibitors.[  3  ] [See Warnings and Precautions (5.  3  )]



     5.2 Thromboembolic Events
 

  Continued treatment using a FVIII-containing VWF product may cause an excessive rise in FVIII activity[  1  ], which may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Monitor plasma levels of VWF:RCo and FVIII activities in patients receiving WILATE to avoid sustained excessive VWF and FVIII activity levels.



     5.3 Neutralizing Antibodies
 

  Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII and VWF in patients with VWD, especially type 3 patients, may occur. If a patient develops inhibitor to VWF (or to FVIII), the condition will manifest itself as an inadequate clinical response. Thus, if expected VWF activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an adequate dose or repeated dosing, perform an appropriate assay to determine whether a VWF inhibitor is present.



  In patients with antibodies against VWF, VWF is not effective and WILATE administration may lead to severe adverse events. Consider other therapeutic options for such patients.
 

  Because inhibitor antibodies may occur concomitantly with anaphylactic reactions, evaluate patients experiencing an anaphylactic reaction for the presence of inhibitors.[  3  ] [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
 

     5.4 Transmissible Infectious Agents
 

  WILATE is made from human plasma. Because this product is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) agent. There is also the possibility that unknown infectious agents may be present in the product. The risk that WILATE will transmit viruses has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain current virus infections, and by inactivating and removing certain viruses during manufacture. Despite these measures, it may still potentially transmit disease. [  5  ]



  Record the batch number of the product every time WILATE is administered to a patient, and consider appropriate vaccination (against hepatitis A and B virus) of patients in regular/repeated receipt of WILATE. ALL infections thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to Octapharma USA, Inc., at 1-866-766-4860.
 

     5.5 Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
 

    *  Monitor plasma levels of VWF:RCo and FVIII activities in patients receiving WILATE to avoid sustained excessive VWF and FVIII activity levels, which may increase the risk of thromboembolism, particularly in patients with known clinical or laboratory risk factors. 
 *  Monitor for development of VWF and FVIII inhibitors. Perform assays to determine whether VWF and/or FVIII inhibitor(s) is present if bleeding is not controlled with the expected dose of WILATE. [  6  ]
