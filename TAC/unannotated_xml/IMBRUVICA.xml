  The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:



 *  Hemorrhage [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
 *  Infections [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  
 *  Cytopenias [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  
 *  Atrial Fibrillation [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  
 *  Second Primary Malignancies [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  
 *  Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ]  
    Because clinical trials are conducted under widely variable conditions, adverse event rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates of clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 

   EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=25%) in patients with B-cell malignancies (MCL, CLL, WM) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, diarrhea, anemia, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, bruising, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, and rash.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

    Mantle Cell Lymphoma  



 The data described below reflect exposure to IMBRUVICA in a clinical trial that included 111 patients with previously treated MCL treated with 560 mg daily with a median treatment duration of 8.3 months.



 The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, neutropenia, anemia, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, bruising, dyspnea, constipation, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting and decreased appetite (see  Tables 1  and  2  ).



 The most common Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological adverse reactions (&gt;= 5%) were pneumonia, abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, diarrhea, fatigue, and skin infections.



 Fatal and serious cases of renal failure have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy. Increases in creatinine 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 9% of patients.



 Adverse reactions from the MCL trial (N=111) using single agent IMBRUVICA 560 mg daily occurring at a rate of &gt;= 10% are presented in Table 1.

         Ten patients (9%) discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions in the trial (N=111). The most frequent adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was subdural hematoma (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 14% of patients.
 

 Patients with MCL who develop lymphocytosis greater than 400,000/mcL have developed intracranial hemorrhage, lethargy, gait instability, and headache. However, some of these cases were in the setting of disease progression.



 Forty percent of patients had elevated uric acid levels on study including 13% with values above 10 mg/dL. Adverse reaction of hyperuricemia was reported for 15% of patients.



     Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  



 The data described below reflect exposure to IMBRUVICA in an open label clinical trial (Study 1) that included 48 patients with previously treated CLL and a randomized clinical trial (Study 2) that included 391 randomized patients with previously treated CLL or SLL.



 The most commonly occurring adverse reactions in Study 1 and Study 2 (&gt;= 20%) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, diarrhea, anemia, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, rash, nausea, and pyrexia.



 Approximately five percent of patients receiving IMBRUVICA in Study 1 and Study 2 discontinued treatment due to adverse events. These included infections, subdural hematomas and diarrhea. Adverse events leading to dose reduction occurred in approximately 6% of patients.

 Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities from the CLL trial (N=48) using single agent IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily occurring at a rate of &gt;= 10% are presented in Tables 3 and 4.

           6. 2 Postmarketing Experience
   The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of IMBRUVICA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock (fatal), urticaria, and angioedema have been reported.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Hemorrhage: Monitor for bleeding (  5.1  ). 
 *  Infections: Monitor patients for fever and infections and evaluate promptly (  5.2  ). 
 *  Cytopenias: Check complete blood counts monthly (  5.3  ). 
 *  Atrial Fibrillation: Monitor patients for atrial fibrillation (  5.4  ). 
 *  Second Primary Malignancies: Other malignancies have occurred in patients, including skin cancers, and other carcinomas (  5.5  ). 
 *  Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Monitor patients at risk for TLS (e.g. high tumor burden) (  5.6  ). 
 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy while taking the drug (  5.7  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Hemorrhage



   Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Grade 3 or higher bleeding events (subdural hematoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria and post procedural hemorrhage) have occurred in up to 6% of patients. Bleeding events of any grade, including bruising and petechiae, occurred in approximately half of patients treated with IMBRUVICA.  



 The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood.



 IMBRUVICA may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies.



 Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA for at least 3 to 7 days pre and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ].  



    5.2 Infections



  Fatal and non-fatal infections have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 14% to 26% of patients. [See  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Monitor patients for fever and infections and evaluate promptly.



    5.3 Cytopenias



  Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias including neutropenia (range, 19 to 29%), thrombocytopenia (range, 5 to 17%), and anemia (range, 0 to 9%) occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA.



 Monitor complete blood counts monthly.



    5.4 Atrial Fibrillation



  Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (range, 6 to 9%) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors, acute infections, and a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically monitor patients clinically for atrial fibrillation. Patients who develop arrhythmic symptoms (e.g., palpitations, lightheadedness) or new onset dyspnea should have an ECG performed. If atrial fibrillation persists, consider the risks and benefits of IMBRUVICA treatment and dose modification [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



    5.5 Second Primary Malignancies



  Other malignancies (range, 5 to 14%) including non-skin carcinomas (range, 1 to 3%) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (range, 4 to 11 %).



    5.6 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



   Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported with IMBRUVICA therapy. Monitor patients closely and take appropriate precautions in patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome (e.g. high tumor burden).  



    5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Ibrutinib caused malformations in rats at exposures 14 times those reported in patients with MCL and 20 times those reported in patients with CLL or WM, receiving the ibrutinib dose of 560 mg per day and 420 mg per day, respectively. Reduced fetal weights were observed at lower exposures. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking IMBRUVICA. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .
