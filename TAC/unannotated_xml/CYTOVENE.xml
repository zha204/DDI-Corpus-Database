  Adverse events that occurred during clinical trials of CYTOVENE-IV solution are summarized below, according to the participating study subject population.



   Subjects With AIDS

  Three controlled, randomized, phase 3 trials comparing CYTOVENE-IV and ganciclovir capsules for maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis have been completed. During these trials, CYTOVENE-IV or ganciclovir capsules were prematurely discontinued in 9% of subjects because of adverse events. Laboratory data and adverse events reported during the conduct of these controlled trials are summarized below.

   The following table shows selected adverse events reported in 5% or more of the subjects in three controlled clinical trials during treatment with either CYTOVENE-IV solution (5 mg/kg/day) or ganciclovir capsules (3000 mg/day), and in one controlled clinical trial with CYTOVENE capsules (3000 mg/day).

          The following events were frequently observed in clinical trials but occurred with equal or greater frequency in placebo-treated subjects: abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, pneumonia, paresthesia, rash.
 

   Retinal Detachment

  Retinal detachment has been observed in subjects with CMV retinitis both before and after initiation of therapy with ganciclovir. Its relationship to therapy with ganciclovir is unknown. Retinal detachment occurred in 11% of patients treated with CYTOVENE-IV solution and in 8% of patients treated with ganciclovir capsules. Patients with CMV retinitis should have frequent ophthalmologic evaluations to monitor the status of their retinitis and to detect any other retinal pathology.



   Transplant Recipients

  There have been three controlled clinical trials of CYTOVENE-IV solution for the prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients. Laboratory data and adverse events reported during these trials are summarized below.



   Laboratory Data

  The following table shows the frequency of granulocytopenia (neutropenia) and thrombocytopenia observed:

             In these three trials, patients receiving CYTOVENE-IV solution had elevated serum creatinine levels when compared to those receiving placebo. Most patients in these studies also received cyclosporine. The mechanism of impairment of renal function is not known. However, careful monitoring of renal function during therapy with CYTOVENE-IV solution is essential, especially for those patients receiving concomitant agents that may cause nephrotoxicity.
