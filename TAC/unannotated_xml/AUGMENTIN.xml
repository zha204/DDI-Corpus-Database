    <Section name="adverse reactions" id="S1">    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:



 *  Anaphylactic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions  (5.1)  ]  
 *  Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions  (5.2)  ]  
 *  CDAD [see Warnings and Precautions  (5.3)  ]  
      EXCERPT:   The most frequently reported adverse effects were diarrhea/loose stools (9%), nausea (3%), skin rashes and urticaria (3%),vomiting (1%) and vaginitis (1%)  (6.1  )
 

   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact    Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or    www.fda.gov/medwatch.      



 

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea/loose stools (9%), nausea (3%), skin rashes and urticaria (3%), vomiting (1%) and vaginitis (1%). Less than 3% of patients discontinued therapy because of drug-related adverse reactions. The overall incidence of adverse reactions, and in particular diarrhea, increased with the higher recommended dose. Other less frequently reported adverse reactions (&lt;1%) include: Abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and headache.



 In pediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years), 1 US/Canadian clinical trial was conducted which compared 45/6.4 mg/kg/day (divided every 12 hours) of AUGMENTIN for 10 days versus 40/10 mg/kg/day (divided every 8 hours) of AUGMENTIN for 10 days in the treatment of acute otitis media. A total of 575 patients were enrolled, and only the suspension formulations were used in this trial. Overall, the adverse reactions seen were comparable to that noted above; however, there were differences in the rates of diarrhea, skin rashes/urticaria, and diaper area rashes.  [See Clinical Studies  (14.2)      ]  



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during postmarketing use of AUGMENTIN.  Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to AUGMENTIN.



   Gastrointestinal:    Indigestion, gastritis, stomatitis, glossitis, black "hairy" tongue, mucocutaneous candidiasis, enterocolitis, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment.  [see Warnings and Precautions  (5.3)  ]  



   Hypersensitivity Reactions:  Pruritus, angioedema, serum sickness-like reactions (urticaria or skin rash accompanied by arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia, and frequently fever), erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute generalized exanthematouspustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and cases of exfoliative dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported.  [see Warnings and Precautions  (5.1)  ]  



   Liver:  Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice, increases in serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT), serum bilirubin, and/or alkaline phosphatase, has been reported with AUGMENTIN. It has been reported more commonly in the elderly, in males, or in patients on prolonged treatment. The histologic findings on liver biopsy have consisted of predominantly cholestatic, hepatocellular, or mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular changes. The onset of signs/symptoms of hepatic dysfunction may occur during or several weeks after therapy has been discontinued. The hepatic dysfunction, which may be severe, is usually reversible. Deaths have been reported.  [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions  (5.2)  ]  



   Renal:  Interstitial nephritis, hematuria, and crystalluria have been reported.  [see Overdosage  (10)  ]  



   Hemic and Lymphatic Systems:  Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosishave been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Thrombocytosis was noted in less than 1% of the patients treated with AUGMENTIN. There have been reports of increased prothrombin time in patients receiving AUGMENTIN and anticoagulant therapy concomitantly.  [see Drug Interactions  (7.2)  ]  



   Central Nervous System:  Agitation, anxiety, behavioral changes, confusion, convulsions, dizziness, insomnia, and reversible hyperactivity have been reported.



   Miscellaneous:  Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining) has been reported. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



  



    EXCERPT:    *  Serious (including fatal) hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue AUGMENTIN if a reaction occurs.  (5.1)   
 *  Hepatic dysfunction and cholestatic jaundice: Discontinue if signs/symptoms of hepatitis occur.  Monitor liver function tests in patients with hepatic impairment.  (5.2)   
 *   Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD): Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs.  (5.3)   
 *  Patients with mononucleosis who receive AUGMENTIN develop skin rash. Avoid AUGMENTIN use in these patients.  (5.4)   
 *  Overgrowth: The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy.  (5.5)   
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials, including AUGMENTIN. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with AUGMENTIN, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, AUGMENTIN should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.



    5.2 Hepatic Dysfunction



  Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice has been associated with the use of AUGMENTIN. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment.



    5.3 Clostridium difficile  Associated Diarrhea (CDAD)



   Clostridium difficile  associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including AUGMENTIN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile  .



  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile  may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.



    5.4 Skin Rash in Patients with Mononucleosis



  A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus, AUGMENTIN should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis.



    5.5 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth



  The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. If superinfection occurs, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.



    5.6 Phenylketonurics



  AUGMENTIN Chewable tablets and AUGMENTIN Powder for Oral Solution contain aspartame which contains phenylalanine.  Each 200-mg chewable tablet of AUGMENTIN contains 2.1 mg phenylalanine; each 400-mg chewable tablet contains 4.2 mg phenylalanine; each 5 mL of either the 200 mg/5 mL or 400 mg/5 mL oral suspension contains 7 mg phenylalanine.  The other formulations of AUGMENTIN do not contain phenylalanine.



    5.7   Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria



  Prescribing AUGMENTIN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient, and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.
