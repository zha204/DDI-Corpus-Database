  In controlled clinical trials, the total incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of Westcort Ointment was approximately 12%. These included worsening of condition (2%), transient itching (2%), irritation (1%) and redness (1%). In controlled clinical studies involving pediatric atopic dermatitis patients 2 through 12 years of age (n=64), the incidence of adverse experiences was approximately 28.1%, which is higher than that seen in adult patients. Reported reactions included eczema (12.5%), pruritis (6%), stinging (2%), and dry skin (2%). Patients were not specifically evaluated for signs of atrophy (thinning, telangiectasia, erythema). No studies were performed to assess adrenal suppression and/or growth suppression.
