  Clinical experience with zinc acetate has been limited. The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients with Wilson's disease on zinc therapy: a death following overdosage with zinc sulfate (See  OVERDOSAGE  ) and a death in a patient with advanced liver disease and hemolytic crisis where zinc sulfate was used as initial treatment; gastric irritation; elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase, amylase and lipase lasting from weeks to months suggesting pancreatitis. The levels usually return to high normal within the first one or two years of zinc therapy.
