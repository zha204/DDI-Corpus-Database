  Enalapril Maleate and Hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in more than 1500 patients, including over 300 patients treated for one year or more. In clinical trials with Enalapril Maleate and Hydrochlorothiazide no adverse experiences peculiar to this combination drug have been observed. Adverse experiences that have occurred, have been limited to those that have been previously reported with enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide.



 The most frequent clinical adverse experiences in controlled trials were: dizziness (8.6 percent), headache (5.5 percent), fatigue (3.9 percent) and cough (3.5 percent). Generally, adverse experiences were mild and transient in nature. Adverse experiences occurring in greater than two percent of patients treated with Enalapril Maleate and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets in controlled clinical trials are shown below.

         Clinical adverse experiences occurring in 0.5 to 2.0 percent of patients in controlled trials included:  Body As A Whole:  Syncope, chest pain, abdominal pain;  Cardiovascular:  Orthostatic hypotension, palpitation, tachycardia;  Digestive:  Vomiting, dyspepsia, constipation, flatulence, dry mouth;  Nervous/Psychiatric:  Insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo;  Skin:  Pruritus, rash;  Other:  Dyspnea, gout, back pain, arthralgia, diaphoresis, decreased libido, tinnitus, urinary tract infection.
 

   Angioedema:  Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving Enalapril Maleate and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, with an incidence higher in black than in non-black patients. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx occurs, treatment with Enalapril Maleate and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately (see  WARNINGS  ).



   Hypotension:  In clinical trials, adverse effects relating to hypotension occurred as follows: hypotension (0.9 percent), orthostatic hypotension (1.5 percent), other orthostatic effects (2.3 percent). In addition syncope occurred in 1.3 percent of patients (see  WARNINGS  ).



   Cough:  See  PRECAUTIONS,    Cough  .



   Clinical Laboratory Test Findings  



   Serum Electrolytes:  See  PRECAUTIONS  .



   Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen:  In controlled clinical trials minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, were observed in about 0.6 percent of patients with essential hypertension treated with ENALAPRIL MALEATE and HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE TABLETS. More marked increases have been reported in other enalapril experience. Increases are more likely to occur in patients with renal artery stenosis (see  PRECAUTIONS  ).



   Serum Uric Acid, Glucose, Magnesium, and Calcium:  See  PRECAUTIONS  .



   Hemoglobin and Hematocrit:  Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.3 g percent and 1.0 vol percent, respectively) occur frequently in hypertensive patients treated with ENALAPRIL MALEATE and HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE TABLETS but are rarely of clinical importance unless another cause of anemia coexists. In clinical trials, less than 0.1 percent of patients discontinued therapy due to anemia.



   Liver Function Tests:  Rarely, elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred (see  WARNINGS,    Hepatic Failure  ).



 Other adverse reactions that have been reported with the individual components are listed below and, within each category, are in order of decreasing severity.
