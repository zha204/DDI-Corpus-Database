       To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hospira, Inc. at 1-800-441-4100 or electronically at ProductComplaintsPP@hospira.com, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch  .      
   6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Small Cell Lung Cancer    



 Data in the following section are based on the combined experience of 879 patients treated with topotecan, of which 426 patients had small cell lung cancer. Table 1 lists the principal hematologic adverse reactions, and Table 2 lists non-hematologic adverse reactions occurring in at least 15% of patients.

        6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials or listed in other sections of the prescribing information, the following reactions have been identified during post-marketing use of topotecan. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential casual connection to topotecan.



     Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:    Severe bleeding (in association with thrombocytopenia) [    see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)      ].



     Immune System Disorders:    Allergic manifestations; Anaphylactoid reactions.



     Gastrointestinal Disorders:    Abdominal pain potentially associated with neutropenic colitis [    see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)      ]    .    



     Pulmonary Disorders:    Interstitial lung disease [    see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)      ]    .    



     Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:    Angioedema, severe dermatitis, severe pruritus.



     General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:    Inadvertent extravasation [    see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)      ].

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: BONE MARROW SUPPRESSION

  WARNING: BONE MARROW SUPPRESSION

      Do not give Topotecan Injection to patients with baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1,500 cells/mm  3  . In order to monitor the occurrence of bone marrow suppression, primarily neutropenia, which may be severe and result in infection and death, monitor peripheral blood cell counts frequently on all patients receiving Topotecan Injection         [  see               Warnings and Precautions (5.1)            ].    



   EXCERPT:       WARNING: BONE MARROW SUPPRESSION     



       See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.       



     Do not give topotecan injection to patients with baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1,500 cells/mm  3  . In order to monitor the occurrence of bone marrow suppression, primarily neutropenia, which may be severe and result in infection and death, monitor peripheral blood cell counts frequently on all patients receiving topotecan injection. (  5.1  )     
</Section>
    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Bone marrow suppression. Administer topotecan injection only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose if needed. (  5.1  ) 



 
 *   Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. (  5.2  )



 
 *   Interstitial lung disease: Topotecan has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease. Monitor patients for symptoms and discontinue Topotecan Injection if the diagnosis is confirmed. (  5.3  )



 
 *   Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (  5.4  ,  8.1  )



 
    



   5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression



  Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. In the comparative study in small cell lung cancer, the treatment-related death rates were 5% for topotecan injection and 4% for CAV (cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine).



   Neutropenia    



 From a combined experience of patients receiving topotecan which included patients treated for small cell lung cancer: Grade 4 neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm  3  ) was most common during course 1 of treatment (60% of patients) and occurred in 39% of all courses, with a median duration of 7 days. The nadir neutrophil count occurred at a median of 12 days. Therapy-related sepsis or febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, and sepsis was fatal in 1%. Pancytopenia has been reported.



   Thrombocytopenia    



 From a combined experience of patients receiving topotecan which included patients treated for small cell lung cancer: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (&lt;25,000/mm  3  ) occurred in 27% of patients and in 9% of courses, with a median duration of 5 days and platelet nadir at a median of 15 days. Platelet transfusions were given to 15% of patients in 4% of courses.



   Anemia    



 From a combined experience of patients receiving topotecan which included patients treated for small cell lung cancer: Grade 3/4 anemia (&lt;8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients and in 14% of courses. Median nadir was at day 15. Transfusions were needed in 52% of patients in 22% of courses.



   Monitoring of Bone Marrow Function    



 Administer Topotecan Injection only in patients with adequate bone marrow reserves, including baseline neutrophil count of at least 1,500 cells/mm  3  and platelet count at least 100,000/mm  3  . Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with Topotecan Injection. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of Topotecan Injection until neutrophils recover to &gt;1,000 cells/mm  3  , platelets recover to &gt;100,000 cells/mm  3  , and hemoglobin levels recover to 9.0 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary).



    5.2 Neutropenic Colitis



  Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with topotecan. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, consider the possibility of neutropenia colitis.



    5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease



  Topotecan has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some which have been fatal [  see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)      ]. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue Topotecan Injection if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed.



    5.4 Pregnancy



  Pregnancy Category D



 Topotecan Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.



 Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. There are no adequate and well controlled studies of topotecan in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving Topotecan Injection, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [  see  Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1)      ].



    5.5 Inadvertent Extravasation



  Inadvertent extravasation with topotecan has been observed. Most reactions have been mild but severe cases have been reported.
