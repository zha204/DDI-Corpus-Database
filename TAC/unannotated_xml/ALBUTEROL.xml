            There was one case of ST segment depression in the 1.25 mg Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution treatment group.  
 

   No clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities related to Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution administration were seen in this study.  



   Post-marketing Experience

  Metabolic acidosis has been reported after the use of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution. Because this reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
