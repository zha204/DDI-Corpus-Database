  Neomycin occasionally causes skin sensitization.



 Ototoxicity (see  WARNINGS  section) and nephrotoxicity have also been reported. Adverse reactions have occurred with topical use of antibiotic combinations. Exact incidence figures are not available since no denominator of treated patients is available. The reaction occurring most often is allergic sensitization. In one clinical study, using a 20% neomycin patch, neomycin-induced allergic skin reactions occurred in two of 2,175 (0.09%) individuals in the general populaton. In another study the incidence was found to be approximately 1%.



 The following local adverse events have been reported with topical corticosteroids, especially under occlusive dressings: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria.
