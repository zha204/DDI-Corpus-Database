  The most common adverse reactions reported in &gt;= 5% of clinical trial subjects occurring during or within 48 hours of an infusion were headache, nausea, chills, asthenia (fatigue), pyrexia, upper abdominal pain, diarrhea, back pain, hyperhidrosis, and flushing.



 There were no serious adverse events that were attributed to GAMMAGARD S/D in the clinical trials.



 In postmarketing surveillance, serious adverse reactions reported with GAMMAGARD S/D were anaphylaxis, acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident, transient ischemic attack, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism; aseptic meningitis, acute hemolysis, and TRALI.



    EXCERPT:    *  The most common adverse reactions observed in &gt;= 5% of patients during the clinical trials were headache, nausea, chills, fatigue, pyrexia, upper abdominal pain, diarrhea, back pain, infusion site pain, hyperhidrosis and flushing (  6.1  ). 
 *  Severe adverse reactions reported postmarketing include renal failure, thrombotic events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, and pulmonary embolism), anaphylactic shock, aseptic meningitis and hemolysis.(  6.2  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

     Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.  



   Primary Immunodeficiency (PI)  



 In 17 patients receiving GAMMAGARD (5% solution) for 56 to 77 months, 12 (71%) were adults, and 5 (29%) were children (16 years or younger).  3  Adverse reactions are those adverse events (AEs) that were deemed by the investigators as causally related to the infusion of GAMMAGARD. Twenty-one adverse reactions occurred in 6 of the 17 subjects of the total 341 infusions (6%). There was one death in a woman from a cerebral vascular hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia and was considered unrelated to study product. Of the 5 subjects who received an infusion with 600 mg/kg at a rate of 0.3  g/kg/hour, two subjects experienced adverse reactions, with an adverse reaction rate of 40%.



 The adverse reactions occurred in &gt;= 5% of subjects during or within 48 hours of infusion are listed in  Table 2  .

         In a double blind, crossover study, 36 subjects with PI were treated for 6 months with GAMMAGARD S/D and 6 months with Gamimune N. One hundred AEs were considered to be possibly or probably related to treatment with GAMMAGARD S/D. Of these, 72 were mild, 24 were moderate, and 4 were severe. The numbers and percentages of AEs were similar for GAMMAGARD S/D and Gamimune-N. There were no deaths during the study. The adverse reactions that occurred during GAMMAGARD S/D treatment in &gt;= 5% of subjects in the study are shown in  Table 3  .

         In 10 subjects who participated in a PK crossover study of GAMMAGARD and GAMMAGARD S/D 5 adverse reactions were reported to be associated with the total 28 infusions (17.5%). Three of the adverse reactions were associated with 10 GAMMAGARD infusions and 2 were associated with 18 GAMMAGARD S/D infusions. Two subjects withdrew from the study. One subject developed a recurrence of chronic cellulitis and was hospitalized and the event was not considered to be related to study drug. The other subject withdrew due to the experience of moderate severe adverse reactions such as chills, anxiety and increased temperature after infusion of GAMMAGARD.
 

 Adverse reactions occurred in the PK study and in the safety study are shown in  Table 4  .

        The tolerability and viral safety of GAMMAGARD S/D were evaluated in a study of 38 subjects, who were treated with GAMMAGARD S/D for an average of 7.7 months. Adverse reactions were reported from 20 of the 38 subjects (52.6%) in 50 of the total 394 infusions (12.7%) during or within 48 hours of an infusion. Twenty-four (48%) of the adverse reactions occurred in 3 subjects and 26 occurred in the other 35 subjects in 350 infusions. No subject withdrew during the study. Five subjects had a transient borderline elevation in liver enzyme (AST). No subject developed a positive serologic response to Hepatitis C or HIV. There were no other significant laboratory abnormalities.
 

 The adverse experiences of GAMMAGARD S/D reconstituted as a 10% solution and the maximal tolerated infusion rate were examined in a post-marketing study of 27 subjects. Local pain and/or irritation occurred in 42 of the total 276 infusions (15.2%). Ninety percent of the reactions occurred when the patients received the 10% solution compared to the 5% control. These local reactions tended to be more common following hand vein infusions and their incidence may be reduced by infusions via the antecubital vein. Application of a warm compress to the infusion site alleviated local symptoms. Twenty-six subjects were able to achieve the maximal infusion rate of 8 mL/kg/hour with the GAMMAGARD S/D reconstituted to a 10% solution.



   B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)  



 In the study of 81 patients with B-cell CLL, the incidence of adverse reactions following GAMMAGARD infusions was approximately 1.3% compare to the rate of the placebo (normal saline) group which was 0.6%.  3  There were 23 adverse reactions associated with the 1235 infusions in the study. Sixteen of the adverse reactions occurred in the GAMMAGARD group (1.6%) and 7 in the control group (0.6%). The most common reactions were fever and chills. Sleepiness was noted during 4 infusions. One subject had a myocardial infarction which was considered to be unrelated to the GAMMAGARD. Twenty-four of the subjects did not complete all 17 infusions. Three subjects in each group died during the study, five of whom were due to infection. The other 18 subjects withdrew for reasons unrelated to the treatment.



   Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)  



 During the clinical study of GAMMAGARD for the treatment of ITP, headache occurred in 12 of 16 subjects (75%) and was the only adverse reaction reported. Of these 12 subjects, 11 had chronic ITP (9 adults, 2 children), and one child had acute ITP. Oral antihistamines and analgesics alleviated the symptoms and were used as pretreatment for those subjects requiring additional IGIV therapy.



   Kawasaki Syndrome  



 In a study of 51 subjects with Kawasaki syndrome, no hypersensitivity-type reactions (urticaria, bronchospasm or generalized anaphylaxis) were reported in subjects receiving either a single 1g/kg dose or 400 mg/kg of GAMMAGARD for four consecutive days.  Adverse reactions, including chills, flushing, cramping, headache, hypotension, nausea, rash and wheezing, were reported with both dose regimens. These adverse reactions occurred in 7 of the 51 (13.7%) subjects associated with 7 of the 129 (5.4%) infusions. Of the 25 subjects who received a single 1 g/kg dose, 4 subjects (16%) experienced adverse reactions. Of the 26 subjects who received 400 mg/kg/day over 4 days, 3 (11.5%) experienced adverse reactions. 



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

    Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily post-approval from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure.  



 The following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of GAMMAGARD S/D (  Table 5  ).

 *  Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephropathy, and death may occur with the intravenous administration of human immune globulin products, particularly those products that contain sucrose. GAMMAGARD S/D does not contain sucrose. 
 *  For patients at risk of renal dysfunction or failure, administer GAMMAGARD S/Dat the minimum rate of infusion practicable. 
</Section>
    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  IgA deficient patients with antibodies to IgA are at greater risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylactic reactions. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Monitor renal function, including blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and urine output in patients at risk of acute renal failure. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Thrombotic and thromboembolic events have been reported with GAMMAGARD S/D. Monitor patients with known risk factors for thrombotic events; consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity for those at risk for hyperviscosity. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS) has been reported with GAMMAGARD S/D. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Hemolytic anemia can develop. Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions (transfusion-related acute lung injury, TRALI). (  5.6  ) 
 *  Product is made from human plasma and may contain infectious agents, e.g., viruses and theoretically, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease agent. (  5.7  ) 
 *  Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity and hyponatremia may occur may occur. (  5.8  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity



  Severe hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylactic reactions with a fall in blood pressure have occurred in patients receiving GAMMAGARD S/D, including patients who tolerated previous treatments with GAMMAGARD S/D, even though it contains low levels of IgA. If hypersensitivity reaction develops, discontinue GAMMAGARD S/D infusion immediately and institute appropriate treatment.



 GAMMAGARD S/D contains trace amounts of IgA (&lt;= 2.2 ug/mL in a 5% solution). Patients with IgA deficiency and antibodies to IgA have a greater risk of developing potentially severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. GAMMAGARD S/D is contraindicated in patients with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity reaction (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS  [4]  ).



    5.2 Renal Dysfunction Failure



  Acute renal failure has been reported in association with GAMMAGARD S/D. Acute renal dysfunction/failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal tubular nephropathy, osmotic nephrosis and death have been reported in patients receiving IGIV, particularly those products containing sucrose.  10  GAMMAGARD S/D does not contain sucrose.



 Assure that patients are not volume depleted prior to the initiation of the infusion of GAMMAGARD S/D.   In patients who are at risk of developing renal dysfunction, because of pre-existing renal insufficiency or predisposition to acute renal failure (such as diabetes mellitus, age greater than 65, volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, or patients receiving known nephrotoxic drugs, etc.), administer GAMMAGARD S/D at an infusion rate less than 4 mL/kg/hour (&lt; 3.3 mg IG/kg/min) for a 5% solution or at a rate less than 2 mL/kg/hour (&lt; 3.3 mg IG/kg/min) for a 10 % solution (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2]).    



 Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to be at increased risk for developing acute renal failure. Assess renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of GAMMAGARD S/D and again at appropriate intervals thereafter. If renal function deteriorates, consider discontinuation of GAMMAGARD S/D.



    5.3 Thromboembolic Events



  Thromboembolic  events, including myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism, have been reported in association with IGIV therapy, including GAMMAGARD S/D (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS [6])    .  10,11  Patients at risk for thromboembolic  events include those with a history of atherosclerosis, multiple cardiovascular risk factors, advanced age, impaired cardiac output, known or suspected hyperviscosity, hypercoagulable disorders, prolonged periods of immobilization, obesity, diabetes mellitus, acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorder, a history of vascular diseases, and a history of a previous thrombotic or thromboembolic event (see   WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  [5.9]  ).



 Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies ( see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS     [5.9]  ). For patients judged to be at risk of developing thrombotic events, administer GAMMAGARD S/D at the minimum rate of infusion practicable  (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2.3]).    



    5.4 Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS)



  AMS has been reported to occur in association with IGIV therapy, including GAMMAGARD S/D. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae. The syndrome of AMS usually begins within several hours to two days following IGIV treatment.



 AMS is characterized by the following symptoms and signs: severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, nausea and vomiting. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cubic mm, predominantly from the granulocytic series, and with elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dL, but negative culture results. Conduct a thorough neurological examination on patients exhibiting such symptoms and signs, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis.



 AMS may occur more frequently with high dose (2 g/kg) IGIV treatment.  12  



    5.5 Hemolysis



  Hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy, including GAMMAGARD S/D. (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    (6.2)) GAMMAGARD S/D contains blood group antibodies which may act as hemolysins and induce in vivo  coating of red blood cells (RBC) with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and, rarely, hemolysis. Acute intravascular hemolysis has been reported, and delayed hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration  (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS  (6.2))  .



 Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis.  If signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis are present after GAMMAGARD S/D infusion, perform appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing.



    5.6 Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)



  Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (TRALI) has been reported in patients following the administration of gammaglobulin products, including GAMMAGARD S/D therapy (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    (6.2)). TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever. Symptoms typically occur within 1 to 6 hours after treatment.



 Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions .  If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil and anti-HLA antibodies in both the product and patient serum. TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support.



    5.7 Transmissible Infectious Agents



  Because GAMMAGARD S/D is made from human plasma, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for GAMMAGARD S/D. All infections thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to Baxter Healthcare Corporation at 1-800-423-2862 (in the U.S.) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch  . The physician should discuss the risks and benefits of this product with the patient.



    5.8 Hyperproteinemia, Increased Serum Viscosity, and Hypernatremia



  Hyperproteinemia and increased serum viscosity may occur in patients receiving GAMMAGARD S/D.



 The amount of sodium in the product may add materially to the recommended daily allowance of dietary sodium for patients on a low sodium diet. In these patients, calculate the amount of sodium from the product and use it when determining dietary sodium intake. GAMMAGARD S/D contains approximately 0.85% NaCI or approximately 3340 mg sodium/liter at a 5% concentration. A 70 kg patient receiving 1g/kg (1.4 L) of the product would receive 4676 mg of sodium.



    5.9 Monitoring: Laboratory Tests



    *  Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output should be considered in patients judged to be at increased risk of developing acute renal failure. Assess renal function, including measurement of BUN and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of GAMMAGARD S/D and at appropriate intervals thereafter.  10   
 *  Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies because of the potentially increased risk of thrombosis. 
 *  If signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis are present after an infusion of GAMMAGARD S/D, perform appropriate laboratory testing for confirmation. 
 *  If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies and anti-HLA antibodies in both the product and patient's serum. 
       5.10 Interference with Laboratory Tests
 

  After infusion of IgG, the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient's blood may yield false positive serological testing results, with the potential for misleading interpretation. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens (e.g., A, B, and D) may cause a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs') test.



    5.11 Rubber Latex Sensitivity



  Certain components used in the packaging of this product contain natural rubber latex. Use GAMMAGARD S/D cautiously in patients with sensitivity to rubber latex.
