  A garlic-like taste may be noted by the patient within a few minutes after instillation of RIMSO-50  (r)  (dimethyl sulfoxide). This taste may last several hours and because of the presence of metabolites, an odor on the breath and skin may remain for 72 hours.



 Transient chemical cystitis has been noted following instillation of dimethyl sulfoxide.



 The patient may experience moderately severe discomfort on administration. Usually this becomes less prominent with repeated administration.
