  EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=10%) are: fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, back pain, pain in extremities, and upper abdominal pain (  6.1  )  To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genzyme Corporation at 1-800-745-4447 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch  



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The most common adverse reactions to CERDELGA (occurring in &gt;=10% of the 126 GD1 patients treated with CERDELGA across Trials 1 and 2) were fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, back pain, pain in extremities, and upper abdominal pain.



 The adverse reaction profile of CERDELGA is based on two controlled studies, Trials 1 and 2. Table 1 presents the profile from the 9-month double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 40 treatment-naive patients (Trial 1). Patients were between the ages of 16 and 63 on the date of the first dose of study drug, and included 20 males and 20 females.

         Table 2 presents the profile from the 12-month open-label, randomized, imiglucerase-controlled trial of 159 treated patients switching from enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) (Trial 2).

 Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring in &gt;=5% of GD1 Patients Switching from Enzyme Replacement Therapy to CERDELGA and More Frequently than Imiglucerase (Trial 2)Trial 2 was not designed to support comparative claims for CERDELGA for the adverse reactions reported in this table.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  ECG Changes and Potential for Cardiac Arrhythmias: Not recommended in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease, long QT syndrome, and concomitant use of Class IA and Class III antiarrhythmics (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Drug-Drug Interactions



  Eliglustat is a CYP2D6 and CYP3A substrate. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP3A metabolism pathways may significantly increase the exposure to eliglustat and result in prolongation of the PR, QTc, and/or QRS cardiac intervals that could result in cardiac arrhythmias [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  . Some drugs that are inhibitors of CYP2D6 and CYP3A are contraindicated with CERDELGA depending on the patient's CYP2D6 metabolizer status [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  . See  Table 3  and  Table 4  for other potentially significant drug interactions [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .



    5.2 ECG Changes and Potential for Cardiac Arrhythmias



  Use of CERDELGA in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions has not been studied during clinical trials. Because CERDELGA is predicted to cause increases in ECG intervals (PR, QTc, and QRS) at substantially elevated eliglustat plasma concentrations, use of CERDELGA is not recommended in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease (congestive heart failure, recent acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia, heart block, ventricular arrhythmia), long QT syndrome, and in combination with Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  .
