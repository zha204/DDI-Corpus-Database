   EXCERPT:    *  In the placebo-controlled factorial design study, the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with TWYNSTA tablets were peripheral edema, dizziness, and hypotension, each leading to discontinuation of &lt;=0.5% of TWYNSTA-treated patients. Adverse reactions that occurred at a &gt;=2% higher incidence on TWYNSTA tablets than placebo were peripheral edema (4.8% vs 0%), dizziness (3.0% vs 2.2%), and back pain (2.2% vs 0%).  (6.1)   
        To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch  .    
 

 



 



 

  6.1  Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     TWYNSTA Tablets    The concomitant use of telmisartan and amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 3700 patients with hypertension; approximately 1900 of these patients were exposed for at least 6 months and over 160 of these patients were exposed for at least one year. Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy.



 In the placebo-controlled factorial design study, the population treated with a telmisartan and amlodipine combination had a mean age of 53 years and included approximately 50% males, 79% were Caucasian, 17% Blacks, and 4% Asians. Patients received doses ranging from 20/2.5 mg to 80/10 mg orally, once daily.



 The frequency of adverse reactions was not related to gender, age, or race.



 The adverse reactions that occurred in the placebo-controlled factorial design trial in &gt;=2% of patients treated with TWYNSTA and at a higher incidence in TWYNSTA-treated patients (n=789) than placebo-treated patients (n=46) were peripheral edema (4.8% vs 0%), dizziness (3.0% vs 2.2%), and back pain (2.2% vs 0%). Edema (other than peripheral edema), hypotension, and syncope were reported in &lt;2% of patients treated with TWYNSTA tablets.



 In the placebo-controlled factorial design trial, discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 2.2% of all treatment cells of patients in the telmisartan/amlodipine-treated patients and in 4.3% in the placebo-treated group. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with TWYNSTA tablets were peripheral edema, dizziness, and hypotension (each &lt;=0.5%).



 Peripheral edema is a known, dose-dependent adverse reaction of amlodipine, but not of telmisartan. In the factorial design study, the incidence of peripheral edema during the 8 week, randomized, double-blind treatment period was highest with amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy. The incidence was notably lower when telmisartan was used in combination with amlodipine 10 mg.



 Table 1: Incidence of Peripheral Edema During the 8 Week Treatment Period 
                    Telmisartan     
                  Placebo          40 mg            80 mg             
     Amlodipine      Placebo          0%               0.8%             0.7%

 10 mg            17.8%            6.2%             11.3%             
          Telmisartan    Telmisartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 3700 patients, including 1900 treated for over 6 months and more than 1300 for over one year. Adverse experiences have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy.
 

 In placebo-controlled trials involving 1041 patients treated with various doses of telmisartan (20 to 160 mg) monotherapy for up to 12 weeks, an overall incidence of adverse events was similar to the patients treated with placebo.



 Adverse events occurring at an incidence of &gt;=1% in patients treated with telmisartan and at a greater rate than in patients treated with placebo, irrespective of their causal association, are presented in Table 2.



 Table 2: Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of &gt;=1% in Patients Treated with Telmisartan and at a Greater Rate than Patients Treated with Placebo 
                    Telmisartann=1455%      Placebon=380%     
 Upper respiratory tract infection  7                6                 
 Back pain        3                1                 
 Sinusitis        3                2                 
 Diarrhea         3                2                 
 Pharyngitis      1                0                 
      In addition to the adverse events in the table, the following events occurred at a rate of &gt;=1% but were at least as frequent in the placebo group: influenza-like symptoms, dyspepsia, myalgia, urinary tract infection, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, pain, fatigue, coughing, hypertension, chest pain, nausea, and peripheral edema. Discontinuation of therapy because of adverse events was required in 2.8% of 1455 patients treated with telmisartan tablets and 6.1% of 380 placebo patients in placebo-controlled clinical trials.
 

 The incidence of adverse events was not dose-related and did not correlate with gender, age, or race of patients.



 The incidence of cough occurring with telmisartan in 6 placebo-controlled trials was identical to that noted for placebo-treated patients (1.6%).



 In addition to those listed above, adverse events that occurred in &gt;0.3% of 3500 patients treated with telmisartan monotherapy in controlled or open trials are listed below. It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to telmisartan tablets:    Autonomic Nervous System:    impotence, increased sweating, flushing;    Body as a Whole:    allergy, fever, leg pain, malaise;    Cardiovascular:    palpitation, dependent edema, angina pectoris, tachycardia, leg edema, abnormal ECG;    CNS:    insomnia, somnolence, migraine, vertigo, paresthesia, involuntary muscle contractions, hypoesthesia;    Gastrointestinal:    flatulence, constipation, gastritis, vomiting, dry mouth, hemorrhoids, gastroenteritis, enteritis, gastroesophageal reflux, toothache, non-specific gastrointestinal disorders;    Metabolic:    gout, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus;    Musculoskeletal:    arthritis, arthralgia, leg cramps;    Psychiatric:    anxiety, depression, nervousness;    Resistance Mechanism:    infection, fungal infection, abscess, otitis media;    Respiratory:    asthma, bronchitis, rhinitis, dyspnea, epistaxis;    Skin:    dermatitis, rash, eczema, pruritus;    Urinary:    micturition frequency, cystitis;    Vascular:    cerebrovascular disorder; and    Special Senses:    abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, tinnitus, earache.



 During initial clinical studies, a single case of angioedema was reported (among a total of 3781 patients treated).



     Clinical Laboratory Findings    In placebo-controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory test parameters were rarely associated with administration of telmisartan tablets.    Hemoglobin:    A greater than 2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin was observed in 0.8% telmisartan patients compared with 0.3% placebo patients. No patients discontinued therapy due to anemia.    Creatinine:    A 0.5 mg/dL rise or greater in creatinine was observed in 0.4% telmisartan patients compared with 0.3% placebo patients. One telmisartan-treated patient discontinued therapy due to increases in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen.    Liver Enzymes:    Occasional elevations of liver chemistries occurred in patients treated with telmisartan; all marked elevations occurred at a higher frequency with placebo. No telmisartan-treated patients discontinued therapy due to abnormal hepatic function.



     Amlodipine    Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine (n=1730) in doses up to 10 mg to placebo (n=1250), discontinuation of amlodipine due to adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of amlodipine-treated patients and was not significantly different from that seen in placebo-treated patients (about 1%). The most common side effects were headache and edema. The incidence (%) of side effects which occurred in a dose-related manner are presented in Table 3.



 Table 3: Incidence (%) of Dose-Related Adverse Effects with Amlodipine at Doses of 2.5 mg, 5.0 mg, and 10.0 mg or Placebo

      The following events occurred in &lt;1% but &gt;0.1% of patients in controlled clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain; they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship:    Cardiovascular:     arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, chest pain, hypotension, peripheral ischemia, syncope, tachycardia, postural dizziness, postural hypotension, vasculitis;    Central and Peripheral Nervous System:     hypoesthesia, neuropathy peripheral, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo;    Gastrointestinal:     anorexia, constipation, dyspepsia,  **  dysphagia, diarrhea, flatulence, pancreatitis, vomiting, gingival hyperplasia, change of bowel habit;    General:     allergic reaction, asthenia,  **  back pain, hot flushes, malaise, pain, rigors, weight gain, weight decrease;    Musculoskeletal System:     arthralgia, arthrosis, muscle cramps,** myalgia;    Psychiatric:     sexual dysfunction (male** and female), insomnia, nervousness, depression, abnormal dreams, anxiety, depersonalization, mood change;    Respiratory System:     dyspnea,  **  epistaxis;    Skin and Appendages:     angioedema, erythema multiforme, pruritus,  **  rash,  **  rash erythematous, rash maculopapular;    Special Senses:     abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye pain, tinnitus;    Urinary System:     micturition frequency, micturition disorder, nocturia;    Autonomic Nervous System:     dry mouth, sweating increased;    Metabolic and Nutritional:     hyperglycemia, thirst;    Hemopoietic:     leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia.  **  These events occurred in less than 1% in placebo-controlled trials, but the incidence of these side effects was between 1% and 2% in all multiple dose studies.
 

 The following events occurred in &lt;0.1% of patients: cardiac failure, pulse irregularity, extrasystoles, skin discoloration, urticaria, skin dryness, alopecia, dermatitis, muscle weakness, twitching, ataxia, hypertonia, migraine, cold and clammy skin, apathy, agitation, amnesia, gastritis, increased appetite, loose stools, coughing, rhinitis, dysuria, polyuria, parosmia, taste perversion, abnormal visual accommodation, and xerophthalmia.



 Other reactions occurred sporadically and cannot be distinguished from medications or concurrent disease states such as myocardial infarction and angina.



 Amlodipine has not been associated with clinically significant changes in routine laboratory tests. No clinically relevant changes were noted in serum potassium, serum glucose, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine.



 Amlodipine has been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, well-compensated congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and abnormal lipid profiles.



 Adverse reactions reported for amlodipine for indications other than hypertension may be found in the prescribing information for Norvasc  (r)  .



   6.2  Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of telmisartan or amlodipine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors:  (1)  seriousness of the reaction,  (2)  frequency of reporting, or  (3)  strength of causal connection to telmisartan or amlodipine.



     Telmisartan    The most frequently spontaneously reported events include: headache, dizziness, asthenia, coughing, nausea, fatigue, weakness, edema, face edema, lower limb edema, angioneurotic edema, urticaria, hypersensitivity, sweating increased, erythema, chest pain, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, blood pressure increased, hypertension aggravated, hypotension (including postural hypotension), hyperkalemia, syncope, dyspepsia, diarrhea, pain, urinary tract infection, erectile dysfunction, back pain, abdominal pain, muscle cramps (including leg cramps), myalgia, bradycardia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, uric acid increased, abnormal hepatic function/liver disorder, renal impairment including acute renal failure, anemia, and increased CPK, anaphylactic reaction, tendon pain (including tendonitis, tenosynovitis), drug eruption (e.g., toxic skin eruption mostly reported as toxicoderma, rash, and urticaria), hypoglycemia (in diabetic patients), and angioedema (with fatal outcome).



 Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers, including telmisartan.



     Amlodipine    Gynecomastia has been reported infrequently and a causal relationship is uncertain. Jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine.

   5.1  Fetal Toxicity



    Pregnancy Category D    



    Telmisartan      Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue TWYNSTA as soon as possible  [see Use in Specific Populations  (8.1)  ]    .
 

    5.2  Hypotension



     Telmisartan      In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of therapy with TWYNSTA tablets. Either correct this condition prior to administration of TWYNSTA tablets, or start treatment under close medical supervision with a reduced dose.
 

 If hypotension does occur, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.



   Amlodipine    



 Symptomatic hypotension is possible, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely.



    5.3  Hyperkalemia



     Telmisartan      Hyperkalemia may occur in patients on ARBs, particularly in patients with advanced renal impairment, heart failure, on renal replacement therapy, or on potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that increase potassium levels. Consider periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalances, particularly in patients at risk.
 

    5.4  Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function



     Telmisartan      As the majority of telmisartan is eliminated by biliary excretion, patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency can be expected to have reduced clearance. Initiate telmisartan at low doses and titrate slowly in these patients  [see Dosage and Administration  (2.5)  , Use in Specific Populations  (8.6)  , and Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3)  ]    .
 

    Amlodipine      Amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the liver and the plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) is 56 hours in patients with impaired hepatic function. Since patients with hepatic impairment have decreased clearance of amlodipine, start amlodipine or add amlodipine at 2.5 mg in patients with hepatic impairment. The lowest dose of TWYNSTA is 40/5 mg; therefore, initial therapy with TWYNSTA tablets is not recommended in hepatically impaired patients  [see Use in Specific Populations  (8.6)  ]    .
 

    5.5  Renal Function Impairment



     Telmisartan      As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, anticipate changes in renal function in susceptible individuals. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure or renal dysfunction), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with telmisartan  [see Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3)  ]    .
 

 In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen were observed. There has been no long term use of telmisartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but anticipate an effect similar to that seen with ACE inhibitors.



    5.6  Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System



     Telmisartan       Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy.  
 

  The ONTARGET trial enrolled 25,620 patients &gt;=55 years old with atherosclerotic disease or diabetes with end-organ damage, randomized them to telmisartan only, ramipril only, or the combination, and followed them for a median of 56 months. Patients receiving the combination of telmisartan and ramipril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy, but experienced an increased incidence of renal dysfunction (e.g., acute renal failure) compared with groups receiving telmisartan alone or ramipril alone.  



  In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure renal function and electrolytes in patients on TWYNSTA and other agents that affect the RAS.  



  Do not co-administer aliskiren with TWYNSTA in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with TWYNSTA in patients with renal impairment (GFR &lt;60 mL/min /1.73 m  2  ).  



    5.7  Risk of Myocardial Infarction or Increased Angina



    Amlodipine    



 Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of TWYNSTA, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.



    5.8  Heart Failure



     Amlodipine      Closely monitor patients with heart failure.
 

 Amlodipine (5 to 10 mg per day) has been studied in a placebo-controlled trial of 1153 patients with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure on stable doses of ACE inhibitor, digoxin, and diuretics. Follow-up was at least 6 months, with a mean of about 14 months. There was no overall adverse effect on survival or cardiac morbidity (as defined by life-threatening arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for worsened heart failure). Amlodipine has been compared to placebo in four 8 to 12 week studies of patients with NYHA class II/III heart failure, involving a total of 697 patients. In these studies, there was no evidence of worsening of heart failure based on measures of exercise tolerance, NYHA classification, symptoms, or LVEF. In the PRAISE-2 study, 1654 patients with NYHA class III (80%) or IV (20%) heart failure without evidence of underlying ischemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitor (99%), digitalis (99%), and diuretics (99%) were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or amlodipine and followed for a mean of 33 months. While there was no statistically significant difference between amlodipine and placebo in the primary endpoint of all cause mortality (95% confidence limits from 8% reduction to 29% increase on amlodipine), there were more reports of pulmonary edema in the patients on amlodipine.
