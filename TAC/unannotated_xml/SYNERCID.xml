  The safety of  Synercid  was evaluated in 1099 patients enrolled in 5 comparative clinical trials. Additionally, 4 non-comparative clinical trials (3 prospective and 1 retrospective in design) were conducted in which 1199 patients received  Synercid  for infections due to Gram-positive pathogens for which no other treatment option was available. In non-comparative trials, the patients were severely ill, often with multiple co-morbidities or physiological impairments, and may have been intolerant to or failed other antibacterial therapies.



   COMPARATIVE TRIALS

    ADVERSE REACTION SUMMARY - ALL COMPARATIVE STUDIES  

  Safety data are available from five comparative clinical studies (n= 1099  Synercid  ; n= 1095 comparator). One of the deaths in the comparative studies was assessed as possibly related to  Synercid  . The most frequent reasons for discontinuation due to drug-related adverse reactions were as follows:

     CLINICAL REACTIONS - SKIN AND SKIN STRUCTURE STUDIES  

  In two of the five comparative clinical trials  Synercid  (n=450) and comparator regimens (  e.g  ., oxacillin/vancomycin or cefazolin/vancomycin; n=443) were studied for safety and efficacy in the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections. The adverse event profile seen in the  Synercid  patients in these two studies differed significantly from that seen in the other comparative studies. What follows is safety data from these two studies.



 Discontinuation of therapy was most frequently due to the following drug related events:

     CLINICAL ADVERSE REACTIONS  

  Approximately one-third of patients discontinued therapy in these trials due to adverse events. However, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions assessed by the investigator as possibly or probably related to  Synercid  therapy was approximately 5.0%.



 There were three prospectively designed non-comparative clinical trials in patients (n = 972) treated with  Synercid  . One of these studies (301), had more complete documentation than the other two (398A and 398B). The most common events probably or possibly related to therapy were:
