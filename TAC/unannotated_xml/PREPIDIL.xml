   Any fetal heart rate abnormality                         150 (17.0)                 123 (14.5)

         In addition, in other trials amnionitis and intrauterine fetal sepsis have been associated with extra-amniotic intrauterine administration of PGE2. Uterine rupture has been reported in association with the use of PREPIDIL Gel intracervically. Additional events reported in the literature, associated by the authors with the use of PREPIDIL Gel, included premature rupture of membranes, fetal depression (1 min Apgar &lt; 7), and fetal acidosis (umbilical artery pH &lt; 7.15).
 

   Post-marketing surveillance

  Blood and lymphatic system disorders

  An increased risk of post-partum disseminated intravascular coagulation has been described in patients whose labor was induced by pharmacological means, either with dinoprostone or oxytocin (see section    WARNINGS  )  . The frequency of this adverse event, however, appears to be rare (&lt;1 per 1,000 labors).



   Immune system disorders

  Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., Anaphylactic reaction, Anaphylactic shock, Anaphylactoid reaction).
