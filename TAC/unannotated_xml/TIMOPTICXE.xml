  In clinical trials, transient blurred vision upon instillation of the drop was reported in approximately one in three patients (lasting from 30 seconds to 5 minutes). Less than 1% of patients discontinued from the studies due to blurred vision.



 The frequency of patients reporting burning and stinging upon instillation was comparable between TIMOPTIC-XE and TIMOPTIC (approximately one in eight patients).



 Adverse experiences reported in 1-5% of patients were:




 Ocular:               Pain, conjunctivitis, discharge (e.g., crusting), foreign body sensation, itching and tearing;   
 Systemic:             Headache, dizziness, and upper respiratory infections.
