  The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel are:



 *    Toxic Deaths [  see   Boxed Warning   ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)   ] 
 *    Hepatotoxicity [  see   Boxed Warning   ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)   ] 
 *    Neutropenia [  see   Boxed Warning   ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)   ] 
 *    Hypersensitivity [  see   Boxed Warning   ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.4)   ] 
 *    Fluid Retention [  see   Boxed Warning   ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.5)   ] 
    The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 

 Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established.



   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia (  6  )

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

      Breast Cancer    



     Monotherapy with docetaxel for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy    



 Docetaxel 100 mg/m  2  : Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m  2  as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See  Table 3  ).

              Hematologic Reactions    
 

 Reversible marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel [    see    Warnings and Precautions (5.3)    ]. The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm  3  ) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles.



 Febrile neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm  3  with fever &gt;38 degrees C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids.



 Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids.



 Thrombocytopenia (&lt;100,000 cells/mm  3  ) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported.



     Hypersensitivity Reactions    



 Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [    see    Boxed Warning    ,    Warnings and Precautions (5.4)    ]    .    Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy.



     Fluid Retention    



 Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel [    see    Boxed Warning    ,    Dosage and Administration (2.6)    ,    Warnings and Precautions (5.5)    ].



     Cutaneous Reactions    



 Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [    see    Warnings and Precautions (5.7)    ]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling.



 Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain.



     Neurologic Reactions    



 Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [    see    Warnings and Precautions (5.8)    ].



     Gastrointestinal Reactions    



 Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3-5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids.



 Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids.



     Cardiovascular Reactions    



 Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m  2  in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by &gt;=10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal.



     Infusion Site Reactions    



 Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein.



     Hepatic Reactions    



 In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT &gt;1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase &gt;2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT &gt;1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase &gt;2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established.



     Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities    



 Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m  2  in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT &gt;1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase &gt;2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m  2  who had normal LFTs (see Tables  4  and  5  ).

          In the three-arm monotherapy trial, TAX313, which compared docetaxel 60 mg/m  2  , 75 mg/m  2   and 100 mg/m  2  in advanced breast cancer, grade 3/4 or severe adverse reactions occurred in 49.0% of patients treated with docetaxel 60 mg/m  2  compared to 55.3% and 65.9% treated with 75 mg/m  2  and 100 mg/m  2   respectively. Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m  2  vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 mg/m  2  and 100 mg/m  2  respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m  2  compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m  2   and 100 mg/m  2  respectively.
 

 The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m  2  , 75 mg/m  2  , and 100 mg/m  2  respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11% and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively).

           Of the 744 patients treated with TAC, 36.3% experienced severe treatment emergent adverse reactions compared to 26.6% of the 736 patients treated with FAC. Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs.
 

     Fever and Infection    



 Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm.



     Gastrointestinal Reactions    



 In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred.



     Cardiovascular Reactions    



 More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure.



     Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)    



 Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens.

         Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment occurred in 31 patients (7.6%) in the docetaxel+cisplatin arm and 37 patients (9.3%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment attributed to study drug occurred in 9 patients (2.2%) in the docetaxel+cisplatin arm and 8 patients (2.0%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm.
 

 The second comparison in the study, vinorelbine+cisplatin versus docetaxel+carboplatin (which did not demonstrate a superior survival associated with docetaxel, [    see    Clinical Studies (14.3)    ]) demonstrated a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fluid retention, hypersensitivity reactions, skin toxicity, alopecia and nail changes on the docetaxel+carboplatin arm, while a higher incidence of anemia, neurosensory toxicity, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and asthenia was observed on the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm.

     Hypersensitivity     



 Rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication.



     Hepatic     



 Rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported.



     Neurologic     



 Confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug.



     Ophthalmologic     



 Conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion.



     Hearing     



 Rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs.



     Respiratory     



 Dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy.



     Renal     



 Renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs.



     Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders    



 Cases of hyponatremia have been reported.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: TOXIC DEATHS, HEPATOTOXICITY, NEUTROPENIA, HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS, AND FLUID RETENTION

  WARNING: TOXIC DEATHS, HEPATOTOXICITY, NEUTROPENIA, HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS, AND FLUID RETENTION

      The incidence of treatment-related mortality associated with docetaxel therapy is increased in patients with abnormal liver function, in patients receiving higher doses, and in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who receive docetaxel as a single agent at a dose of 100 mg/m  2   [  see         Warnings and Precautions (5.1)      ]  .       



     Docetaxel Injection, USP should not be given to patients with bilirubin &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN), or to patients with AST and/or ALT &gt;1.5 x ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase &gt;2.5 x ULN. Patients with elevations of bilirubin or abnormalities of transaminase concurrent with alkaline phosphatase are at increased risk for the development of grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, infections, severe thrombocytopenia, severe stomatitis, severe skin toxicity, and toxic death. Patients with isolated elevations of transaminase &gt;1.5 x ULN also had a higher rate of febrile neutropenia grade 4 but did not have an increased incidence of toxic death. Bilirubin, AST or ALT, and alkaline phosphatase values should be obtained prior to each cycle of Docetaxel Injection, USP therapy [  see         Warnings and Precautions (5.2)      ].     



     Docetaxel Injection, USP therapy should not be given to patients with neutrophil counts of &lt;1500 cells/mm  3  . In order to monitor the occurrence of neutropenia, which may be severe and result in infection, frequent blood cell counts should be performed on all patients receiving Docetaxel Injection, USP [  see         Warnings and Precautions (5.3)      ].     



     Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients who received a 3-day dexamethasone premedication. Hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the Docetaxel Injection, USP infusion and administration of appropriate therapy [  see         Warnings and Precautions (5.4)      ]. Docetaxel Injection, USP must not be given to patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to docetaxel or to other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80 [  see         Contraindications (4)      ]  .       



     Severe fluid retention occurred in 6.5% (6/92) of patients despite use of a 3-day dexamethasone premedication regimen. It was characterized by one or more of the following events: poorly tolerated peripheral edema, generalized edema, pleural effusion requiring urgent drainage, dyspnea at rest, cardiac tamponade, or pronounced abdominal distention (due to ascites) [  see         Warnings and Precautions (5.5)      ].

 *  Treatment-related mortality increases with abnormal liver function, at higher doses, and in patients with NSCLC and prior platinum-based therapy receiving docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 (5.1) 
 *  Should not be given if bilirubin &gt; ULN, or if AST and/or ALT &gt; 1.5 x ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN. LFT elevations increase risk of severe or life-threatening complications. Obtain LFTs before each treatment cycle (8.6) 
 *  Should not be given if neutrophil counts are &lt; 1500 cells/mm3. Obtain frequent blood counts to monitor for neutropenia (4)

   5.1 Toxic Deaths



    Breast Cancer    



 Docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m  2  was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT &gt;1.5 times ULN together with AP &gt;2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m  2  , mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths.



   Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer    



 Docetaxel administered at a dose of 100 mg/m  2  in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m  2  dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m  2  dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [  see    Dosage and Administration (2.2)   ,    Clinical Studies (14)    ]  .    



    5.2 Hepatic Impairment



  Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection, USP [  see    Boxed Warning   ,    Use in Specific Populations (8.6)   ,    Clinical Studies (14)    ].



    5.3 Hematologic Effects



  Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving Docetaxel Injection, USP. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Docetaxel Injection, USP until neutrophils recover to a level &gt;1500 cells/mm  3  and platelets recover to a level &gt;100,000 cells/mm  3  .



 A 25% reduction in the dose of Docetaxel Injection, USP is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm  3  ) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a Docetaxel Injection, USP cycle [  see    Dosage and Administration (2.7)    ]  .    



 Neutropenia (&lt;2000 neutrophils/mm  3  ) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m  2  to 100 mg/m  2  of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm  3  ) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m  2  and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m  2  . Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel Injection, USP should not be administered to patients with neutrophils &lt;1500 cells/mm  3  .



 Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m  2  but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m  2  .



 Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [  see    Adverse Reactions (6.1)   ,    Clinical Studies (14)    ].



 Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin &gt;1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [  see    Dosage and Administration (2.7)   ,    Adverse Reactions (6)    ]  .    



    5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the Docetaxel Injection, USP infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with Docetaxel Injection, USP.



 Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a Docetaxel Injection, USP infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of Docetaxel Injection, USP [  see    Dosage and Administration (2.6)    ].



    5.5 Fluid Retention



  Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each Docetaxel Injection, USP administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [  see    Dosage and Administration (2.6)    ]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions.



 When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg.



 Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m  2  . Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m  2  .



 Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures,  e.g    ., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s).



    5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia



  Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (  TAX316    ) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [  see    Clinical Studies (14.2)    ]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up.



    5.7 Cutaneous Reaction



  Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [  see    Dosage and Administration (2.7)    ]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity.



    5.8 Neurologic Reactions



  Severe neurosensory symptoms (  e.g.    paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [  see    Dosage and Administration (2.7)    ]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965).



     5.9 Eye Disorders  



   Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with Docetaxel. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, Docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered  . 



    5.10 Asthenia



  Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease.



    5.11 Use in Pregnancy



  Docetaxel Injection, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using Docetaxel Injection, USP. If Docetaxel Injection, USP is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with Docetaxel Injection, USP [  see    Use in Specific Populations (8.1)    ]  .    



     5.12 Alcohol Content  



   Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Docetaxel Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m  2  delivers 2.0 g/m  2  of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m  2  , this would deliver 4.0 grams of ethanol [ see       Description (11)     ]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol.
