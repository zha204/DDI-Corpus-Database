  In controlled clinical trials for the management of  acne vulgaris  , the occurrence of adverse reactions associated with the use of  Klaron Lotion  was infrequent and restricted to local events. The total incidence of adverse reactions reported in these studies was less than 2%. Only one of 105 patients treated with  Klaron Lotion  had adverse reactions of erythema, itching and edema. It has been reported that sodium sulfacetamide may cause local irritation, stinging and burning. While the irritation may be transient, occasionally, the use of medication has to be discontinued.
