  The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:



 *  Serious cardiovascular events and stroke  [see    Boxed Warning    and    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ]  
 *  Vascular events [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ]  
 *  Liver disease [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ]  
    Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are:
 

 *  Irregular uterine bleeding 
 *  Nausea 
 *  Breast tenderness 
 *  Headache 
      EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (&gt;= 2%) are headache, vaginal candidiasis, nausea, menstrual cramps, breast tenderness, bacterial vaginitis, abnormal cervical smear, acne, mood swings, and weight gain (  6.1  ) 
 

   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Allergan at 1-800-433-8871 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

    6.1         Clinical    Trial    Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.  The data presented in Section 6.1 are from a clinical trial conducted with a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets. TAYTULLA is bioequivalent to these norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets.



   Common Adverse Reactions (&gt;= 2% of all Treated Subjects)  : The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 743 women using norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets were the following, in order of decreasing incidence: headache (6.3%), vaginal candidiasis (6.1%), nausea (4.6%), menstrual cramps (4.4%), breast tenderness (3.4%), bacterial vaginitis (3.1%), abnormal cervical smear (3.1%), acne (2.7%), mood swings (2.2%), and weight gain (2.0%).



   Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation  : Among the 743 women using norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets, 46 women (6.2%) withdrew because of an adverse event. Adverse events occurring in 3 or more subjects leading to discontinuation of treatment were, in decreasing order: abnormal or irregular bleeding (1.3%), nausea (0.8%), menstrual cramps (0.5%), and increased blood pressure (0.4%). 



     6.2         Postmarketing Experience  

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Vascular disorders: thrombosis/embolism (coronary artery, pulmonary, cerebral, deep vein).



 Hepatobiliary disorders: cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, hepatic adenoma, hemangioma of liver.



 Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reaction.



 Skin and subcutaneous disorders: alopecia, rash (generalized and allergic), pruritus, skin discoloration.



 GI disorders: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.



 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia.



 Eye disorders: blurred vision, visual impairment, corneal thinning, change in corneal curvature (steepening).

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

    WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS     CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS  

    Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke     [see       Contraindications (4)      ]    .  



   EXCERPT:     WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS  



   See Full Prescribing Information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  Women over 35 years old who smoke should not use TAYTULLA. (4) 
 *  Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. (4) 
</Section>
    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">     5        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *   Vascular risks: Stop  TAYTULLA if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding (  5.1  ) 
 *  Liver disease: Discontinue if jaundice occurs (  5.2  ) 
 *  High blood pressure: Do not prescribe TAYTULLA  for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease (  5.3  ) 
 *  Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking  TAYTULLA . Consider an alternative contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia (  5.5  ) 
 *  Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue TAYTULLA   if indicated (  5.6  ) 
 *  Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea (  5.7  ) 
    
 

    5.1        Thrombo   embo   lic   Disorders   and Other Vascular   Problems  



  Stop TAYTULLA if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurs. Stop TAYTULLA if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.



 If feasible, stop TAYTULLA at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE.



 Start TAYTULLA no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.



 The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.



 Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest in older (&gt; 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with underlying risk factors. 



 Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.



     5.2        Liver Disease  



   Impaired Liver Function  



 Do not use TAYTULLA in women with acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [   see     Contraindications (4)     ]  . Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue TAYTULLA if jaundice develops.



  Liver Tumors  



 TAYTULLA is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see     Contraindications (4)     ]   .  Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.



 Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt;8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.



     5.3        High Blood Pressure  



  TAYTULLA is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see     Contraindications (4)     ]  . For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop TAYTULLA if blood pressure rises significantly.



 An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.



     5.4        Gallbladder Disease  



  Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease.



 A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis.



     5.5        Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects  



  Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking TAYTULLA. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion.



 Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.



 Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.



     5.6        Headache  



  If a woman taking TAYTULLA develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue TAYTULLA if indicated.



 Consider discontinuation of TAYTULLA in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event)  [see     Contraindications (4)     ]  .



     5.7        Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea  



   Unscheduled   Bleeding and Spotting  



 Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.



 Based on patient diaries from a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets, 24-35% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle. A total of 10 subjects out of 743 (1.3%) discontinued due to bleeding or spotting. 



  Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea  



 Women who are not pregnant and use TAYTULLA may experience amenorrhea. In the clinical trial with a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets, 22 to 36% of the women using norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets experienced amenorrhea in at least one of 6 cycles of use. Some women may experience post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent.



 If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active capsules or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.



     5.8        COC Use before or during Early Pregnancy  



  Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue TAYTULLA if pregnancy is confirmed.



 Administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see     Use in Specific Populations (8.1)     ].  



     5.9        Depression  



  Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue TAYTULLA if depression recurs to a serious degree.



     5.10        Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix  



  TAYTULLA is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally-sensitive [see     Contraindications (4)     ]  .



 There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.



 Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.



     5.11        Effect on Binding Globulins  



  The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 



     5.12        Monitoring  



  A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.



     5.13         Hereditary Angioedema  



  In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.



     5.14         Chloasma  



  Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking TAYTULLA.
