  The most common adverse reaction is hypertension associated in several cases with seizure and/or headache. Hypotension has also been reported. Abdominal pain (caused by uterine contractions), nausea and vomiting have occurred occasionally. Rarely observed reactions have included: acute myocardial infarction, transient chest pains, vasoconstriction, vasospasm, coronary arterial spasm, bradycardia, tachycardia, dyspnea, hematuria, thrombophlebitis, water intoxication, hallucinations, leg cramps, dizziness, tinnitus, nasal congestion, diarrhea, diaphoresis, palpitation, rash, and foul taste.



 There have been rare isolated reports of anaphylaxis, without a proven causal relationship to the drug product.



   Postmarketing Experience  



 The following adverse drug reactions have been derived from post-marketing experience with Methergine via spontaneous case reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency which is therefore categorized as not known.



   Nervous system disorders  



 Cerebrovascular accident, paraesthesia



   Cardiac disorders  



 Ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, angina pectoris, atrioventricular block
