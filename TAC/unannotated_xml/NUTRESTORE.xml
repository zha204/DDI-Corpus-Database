  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice



 Table 1 provides the number of subjects by system-organ class experiencing at least one adverse reaction during the 4-week treatment period of the SBS study. To be listed in Table 1, an adverse reaction must have occurred in more than 10% of subjects in any treatment group.

          During the initial 4-week treatment period, 100% of patients receiving growth hormone with and without glutamine reported at least one AR, whereas 89% of patients receiving growth hormone placebo with glutamine reported at least one AR. During weeks 5 to 18, 81% of patients receiving growth hormone with glutamine, 80% of patients receiving growth hormone without glutamine and 78% of patients receiving growth hormone placebo with glutamine experienced at least one AR.

   EXCERPT:    *  Routine monitoring of renal and hepatic function is recommended in patients receiving lPN, particularly in those with renal or hepatic impairment (  5.1  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Increased Serum Ammonia and Glutamate



  Glutamine is metabolized to glutamate and ammonia, which may increase in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Therefore, routine monitoring of renal and hepatic function is recommended in patients receiving intravenous parenteral nutrition (IPN) and NutreStore, particularly in those with renal or hepatic impairment.
