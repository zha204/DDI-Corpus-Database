  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



    EXCERPT:    *  HIT patients: The most common (&gt; 5%) adverse reactions were dyspnea, hypotension, fever, diarrhea, sepsis, and cardiac arrest (  6.1  ) 
 *  PCI patients: The most common (&gt; 5%) adverse reactions were chest pain, hypotension, back pain, nausea, vomiting and headache (  6.2  )

  6.1 Adverse Events in Patients with HIT (With or Without Thrombosis)

  The following safety information is based on all 568 patients treated with argatroban in Study 1 and Study 2. The safety profile of the patients from these studies is compared with that of 193 historical controls in which the adverse events were collected retrospectively. Adverse events are separated into hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic events.



 Major bleeding was defined as bleeding that was overt and associated with a hemoglobin decrease &gt;=2 g/dL, that led to a transfusion of &gt;=2 units, or that was intracranial, retroperitoneal, or into a major prosthetic joint. Minor bleeding was overt bleeding that did not meet the criteria for major bleeding.



 Table 4 gives an overview of the most frequently observed hemorrhagic events, presented separately by major and minor bleeding, sorted by decreasing occurrence among argatroban-treated patients with HIT(with or without thrombosis).

           6.2 Adverse Events in Patients with or at Risk for HIT Patients Undergoing PCI
   The following safety information is based on 91 patients initially treated with argatroban and 21 patients subsequently re-exposed to argatroban for a total of 112 PCIs with argatroban anticoagulation. Adverse events are separated into hemorrhagic (Table 6) and non-hemorrhagic (Table7) events.



 Major bleeding was defined as bleeding that was overt and associated with a hemoglobin decrease &gt;=5 g/dL, that led to a transfusion of &gt;=2 units, or that was intracranial, retroperitoneal, or into a major prosthetic joint.



 The rate of major bleeding events in patients treated with argatroban in the PCI trials was 1.8%.

          6.3 Intracranial Bleeding in Other Populations
   Increased risks for intracranial bleeding have been observed in investigational studies of argatroban for other uses. In a study of patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving both argatroban and thrombolytic therapy (streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator), the overall frequency of intracranial bleeding was 1% (8 out of 810 patients). Intracranial bleeding was not observed in 317 subjects or patients who did not receive concomitant thrombolysis  [see Drug Interactions (  7.4  )]  .



 The safety and effectiveness of argatroban for cardiac indications other than PCI in patients with HIT have not been established. Intracranial bleeding was also observed in a prospective, placebo-controlled study of argatroban in patients who had onset of acute stroke within 12 hours of study entry. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was reported in 5 of 117 patients (4.3%) who received argatroban at 1 to 3 mcg/kg/min and in none of the 54 patients who received placebo. Asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 5 (4.3%) and 2 (3.7%) of the patients, respectively.



   6.4 Allergic Reactions

  One hundred fifty-six allergic reactions or suspected allergic reactions were observed in 1,127 individuals who were treated with argatroban in clinical pharmacology studies or for various clinical indications. About 95% (148/156) of these reactions occurred in patients who concomitantly received thrombolytic therapy (e.g., streptokinase) or contrast media.



 Allergic reactions or suspected allergic reactions in populations other than patients with HIT (with or without thrombosis) include (in descending order of frequency):



  Airway reactions (coughing, dyspnea): 10% or more



  Skin reactions (rash, bullous eruption): 1 to &lt;10%



  General reactions (vasodilation): 1 to 10%



 Limited data are available on the potential formation of drug-related antibodies. Plasma from 12 healthy volunteers treated with argatroban over 6 days showed no evidence of neutralizing antibodies. No loss of anticoagulant activity was noted with repeated administration of argatroban to more than 40 patients.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Risk of hemorrhage: Hemorrhage at any site can occur (unexplained fall in hematocrit or blood pressure or other unexplained symptom may indicate hemorrhage). Use with caution in patients at risk, including those receiving antiplatelet agents, thrombolytics, or other anticoagulants (  5.1  ) 
 *  Use in hepatic impairment: Adjust starting dose and titrate carefully in patients with HIT who have moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Avoid use in PCI in patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Risk of Hemorrhage



  Hemorrhage can occur at any site in the body in patients receiving argatroban. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or hemoglobin or a fall in blood pressure should lead to consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Argatroban Injection should be used with extreme caution in disease states and other circumstances in which there is an increased danger of hemorrhage. These include severe hypertension; immediately following lumbar puncture; spinal anesthesia; major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye; hematologic conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies such as congenital or acquired bleeding disorders and gastrointestinal lesions such as ulcerations.



 Concomitant use of argatroban with antiplatelet agents, thrombolytics, and other anticoagulants may increase the risk of bleeding.



    5.2 Use in Hepatic Impairment



  Use caution when administering argatroban to patients with hepatic impairment by starting with a lower dose and carefully titrating until the desired level of anticoagulation is achieved. Upon cessation of argatroban infusion in the hepatically impaired patient, full reversal of anticoagulant effects may require longer than 4 hours due to decreased clearance and increased elimination half-life of argatroban [see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  . Use of argatroban in PCI patients with clinically significant hepatic disease or AST/ALT levels &gt;=3 times the upper limit of normal should be avoided.



    5.3 Laboratory Tests



  Anticoagulation effects associated with argatroban infusion at doses up to 40 mcg/kg/min correlate with increases of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Although other global clot-based tests including prothrombin time (PT), the International Normalized Ratio (INR), and thrombin time (TT) are affected by argatroban, the therapeutic ranges for these tests have not been identified for argatroban therapy. In clinical trials in PCI, the activated clotting time (ACT) was used for monitoring argatroban anticoagulant activity during the procedure. The concomitant use of argatroban and warfarin results in prolongation of the PT and INR beyond that produced by warfarin alone [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  .
