  Adverse reactions may occur with any given intrathecal injection due to the chemotherapy or the technique of intrathecal administration.  (See product labeling for methotrexate sodium and cytarabine.)



 



 Preservative-free methotrexate sodium and cytarabine should be used to minimize adverse reactions due to preservatives.



 



 If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the administration, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and, if possible, save the remainder of the unused solution(s) for examination.
