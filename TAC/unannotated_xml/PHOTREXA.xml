  The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:



 Ulcerative keratitis [  Warnings and Precautions  (    5    )]



   EXCERPT:   The most common ocular adverse reactions in any CXL-treated eye were corneal opacity (haze), punctate keratitis, corneal striae, corneal epithelium defect, eye pain, reduced visual acuity, and blurred vision (  6.1  ).



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Avedro at 1-844-528-3376 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or    www.fda.gov/medwatch    .  



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience:

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of the corneal collagen cross-linking procedure was evaluated in 3 randomized, parallel-group, open-label, sham-controlled trials; patients were followed up for 12 months. In each study, only one eye of subjects was designated as the study eye. Study eyes were randomized to receive one of the two study treatments (CXL or sham) at the baseline visit and were followed up at Day 1, Week 1, and Months 1, 3, 6, and 12. At Month 3 or later, sham study eyes and non-study eyes had the option of receiving CXL treatment, and were followed-up for 12 months from the time of receiving CXL treatment. Each CXL treated eye received a single course of CXL treatment only.



 Safety data were obtained from 193 randomized CXL study eyes, 191 control eyes, and 319 nonrandomized CXL non-study eyes. Overall, 512 eyes in 364 patients received CXL treatment.



 In progressive keratoconus subjects, the most common ocular adverse reactions in any CXL-treated eye were corneal opacity (haze), punctate keratitis, corneal striae, corneal epithelium defect, eye pain, reduced visual acuity, and blurred vision (  Table 1  ).



 Adverse events reported in non-study, non-randomized CXL treated were similar in in terms of preferred terms and frequency to those seen in randomized study eyes.



 The majority of adverse events reported resolved during the first month, while events such as corneal epithelium defect, corneal striae, punctate keratitis, photophobia, dry eye and eye pain, and decreased visual acuity took up to 6 months to resolve and corneal opacity or haze took up to 12 months to resolve. In 1-2% of patients, corneal epithelium defect, corneal edema, corneal opacity and corneal scar continued to be observed at 12 months.
