  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     Dapagliflozin and Metformin hydrochloride  

  Data from a prespecified pool of patients from 8 short-term, placebo-controlled studies of dapagliflozin coadministered with metformin immediate- or extended-release was used to evaluate safety. This pool included several add-on studies (metformin alone and in combination with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP4] inhibitor and metformin, or insulin and metformin, 2 initial combination with metformin studies, and 2 studies of patients with cardiovascular disease [CVD] and type 2 diabetes who received their usual treatment [with metformin as background therapy]). For studies that included background therapy with and without metformin, only patients who received metformin were included in the 8-study placebo-controlled pool. Across these 8 studies 983 patients were treated once daily with dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin and 1185 were treated with placebo and metformin. These 8 studies provide a mean duration of exposure of 23 weeks. The mean age of the population was 57 years and 2% were older than 75 years. Fifty-four percent (54%) of the population was male; 88% White, 6% Asian, and 3% Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 8 years, mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 8.4%, and renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 90% of patients and moderately impaired in 10% of patients.



 The overall incidence of adverse events for the 8-study, short-term, placebo-controlled pool in patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin was 60.3% compared to 58.2% for the placebo and metformin group. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events in patients who received dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin was 4% compared to 3.3% for the placebo and metformin group. The most commonly reported events leading to discontinuation and reported in at least 3 patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin were renal impairment (0.7%), increased blood creatinine (0.2%), decreased renal creatinine clearance (0.2%), and urinary tract infection (0.2%).



 Table 1 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of dapagliflozin and metformin. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on dapagliflozin and metformin than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either dapagliflozin 5 mg or dapagliflozin 10 mg.

              Metformin hydrochloride  
   In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of metformin extended-release, diarrhea and nausea/vomiting were reported in &gt;5% of metformin-treated patients and more commonly than in placebo-treated patients (9.6% versus 2.6% for diarrhea and 6.5% versus 1.5% for nausea/vomiting). Diarrhea led to discontinuation of study medication in 0.6% of the patients treated with metformin extended-release.



     Pool of 12 Placebo-Controlled Studies for Dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg  

    Dapagliflozin  



 The data in Table 2 are derived from 12 placebo-controlled studies ranging from 12 to 24 weeks. In 4 studies dapagliflozin was used as monotherapy, and in 8 studies dapagliflozin was used as add-on to background antidiabetic therapy or as combination therapy with metformin [see    Clinical Studies (14)    ].



 These data reflect exposure of 2338 patients to dapagliflozin with a mean exposure duration of 21 weeks. Patients received placebo (N=1393), dapagliflozin 5 mg (N=1145), or dapagliflozin 10 mg (N=1193) once daily. The mean age of the population was 55 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty percent (50%) of the population were male; 81% were White, 14% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 6 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.3%, and 21% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 92% of patients and moderately impaired in 8% of patients (mean eGFR 86 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ).



 Table 2 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of dapagliflozin. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on dapagliflozin than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either dapagliflozin 5 mg or dapagliflozin 10 mg.

              Pool of 13 Placebo-Controlled Studies for Dapagliflozin 10 mg  
   The safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin 10 mg was also evaluated in a larger placebo-controlled study pool. This pool combined 13 placebo-controlled studies, including 3 monotherapy studies, 9 add-on to background antidiabetic therapy studies, and an initial combination with metformin study. Across these 13 studies, 2360 patients were treated once daily with dapagliflozin 10 mg for a mean duration of exposure of 22 weeks. The mean age of the population was 59 years and 4% were older than 75 years. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the population were male; 84% were White, 9% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.2%, and 30% had established microvascular disease. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% of patients and moderately impaired in 11% of patients (mean eGFR 82 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ).



     Volume Depletion  

  Dapagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to reductions in intravascular volume. Adverse reactions related to volume depletion (including reports of dehydration, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, or hypotension) are shown in Table 3 for the 12-study and 13-study, short-term, placebo-controlled pools [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.4)    ].

                Impairment of Renal Function  
   Use of dapagliflozin was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR (see Table 4). In patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function at baseline, serum creatinine and eGFR returned to baseline values at Week 24. Renal-related adverse reactions, including renal failure and blood creatinine increase, were more frequent in patients treated with dapagliflozin (see Table 5). Elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function were more susceptible to these adverse reactions (see Table 5). Sustained decreases in eGFR were seen in patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ).

            The safety of dapagliflozin was evaluated in a study of patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ). In this study 13 patients experienced bone fractures for treatment durations up to 104 weeks. No fractures occurred in the placebo group, 5 occurred in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group, and 8 occurred in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group. Eight of these 13 fractures were in patients who had a baseline eGFR of 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m  2  . Eleven of the 13 fractures were reported within the first 52 weeks. There was no apparent pattern with respect to the anatomic site of fracture.
 

     Hypoglycemia  

  The frequency of hypoglycemia by study [see    Clinical Studies (14)    ] is shown in Table 6. Hypoglycemia was more frequent when dapagliflozin was added to sulfonylurea or insulin [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.9)    ].

              Genital Mycotic Infections  
   Genital mycotic infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin treatment. Genital mycotic infections were reported in 0.9% of patients on placebo, 5.7% on dapagliflozin 5 mg, and 4.8% on dapagliflozin 10 mg, in the 12-study placebo-controlled pool. Discontinuation from study due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg. Infections were more frequently reported in females than in males (see Table 2). The most frequently reported genital mycotic infections were vulvovaginal mycotic infections in females and balanitis in males. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to have a genital mycotic infection during the study than those with no prior history (10.0%, 23.1%, and 25.0% versus 0.8%, 5.9%, and 5.0% on placebo, dapagliflozin 5 mg, and dapagliflozin 10 mg, respectively).



     Hypersensitivity Reactions  

  Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, urticaria, hypersensitivity) were reported with dapagliflozin treatment. Across the clinical program, serious anaphylactic reactions and severe cutaneous adverse reactions and angioedema were reported in 0.2% of comparator-treated patients and 0.3% of dapagliflozin-treated patients. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of dapagliflozin; treat per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.



     Laboratory Tests  

    Increase in Hematocrit  

    Dapagliflozin  



 In the pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies, increases from baseline in mean hematocrit values were observed in dapagliflozin-treated patients starting at Week 1 and continuing up to Week 16, when the maximum mean difference from baseline was observed. At Week 24, the mean changes from baseline in hematocrit were -0.33% in the placebo group and 2.30% in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group. By Week 24, hematocrit values &gt;55% were reported in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients and 1.3% of dapagliflozin 10 mg-treated patients.



     Increase in Serum Inorganic Phosphorus  

    Dapagliflozin  



 In the pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies, increases from baseline in mean serum phosphorus levels were reported at Week 24 in dapagliflozin 10 mg-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients (mean increases of 0.13 mg/dL versus -0.04 mg/dL, respectively). Higher proportions of patients with marked laboratory abnormalities of hyperphosphatemia (&gt;=5.6 mg/dL if age 17-65 or &gt;=5.1 mg/dL if age &gt;=66) were reported in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group versus the placebo group at Week 24 (1.7% versus 0.9%, respectively).



     Increase in Low -Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Dapagliflozin  

    Dapagliflozin  



 In the pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies, changes from baseline in mean lipid values were reported in dapagliflozin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. Mean percent change from baseline at Week 24 were 0.0% versus 2.5% for total cholesterol and -1.0% versus 2.9% for LDL cholesterol in the placebo and dapagliflozin 10 mg groups, respectively.



     Vitamin B12Concentrations  

    Metformin hydrochloride  



 Metformin may lower serum vitamin B12concentrations. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on XIGDUO XR and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.12)    ].

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

  WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

    Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation. The risk increases with conditions such as sepsis, dehydration, excess alcohol intake, hepatic impairment, renal impairment, and acute congestive heart failure.  



   The onset of lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress.  



   Laboratory abnormalities include low pH, increased anion gap, and elevated blood lactate.  



   If acidosis is suspected, XIGDUO XR should be discontinued and the patient hospitalized immediately [see     Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ].  



   EXCERPT:   WARNING:  LACTIC ACIDOSIS 



     See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.    



 *  Lactic acidosis can occur due to metformin accumulation. The risk increases with conditions such as sepsis, dehydration, excess alcohol intake, hepatic impairment, renal impairment, and acute congestive heart failure. (5.1) 
 *  Symptoms include malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. Laboratory abnormalities include low pH, increased anion gap, and elevated blood lactate. (5.1)

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Lactic acidosis : Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake. XIGDUO XR should generally be avoided in hepatic impairment and contraindicated in moderate to severe renal impairment. Ensure normal or mildly impaired renal function before initiating and at least annually thereafter. Temporarily discontinue XIGDUO XR in patients undergoing radiologic studies with intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials or any surgical procedures necessitating restricted intake of food and fluids. (  2.2  ,  4  ,  5.1  ,  5.2  ,  5.3  ,  5.5  ,  5.6  ,  5.7  ,  5.8  ,  5.10  ,  5.11  ,  8.5  ,  8.6  ) 
 *     Hypotension : Before initiating XIGDUO XR, assess volume status and correct hypovolemia in the elderly, in patients with renal impairment or low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy. (  5.4  ,  6.1  ) 
 *     Hypoglycemia : In patients taking insulin or an insulin secretagogue with XIGDUO XR, consider a lower dose of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.  (5.9)   
 *     Vitamin B12deficiency : Metformin may lower vitamin B12levels. Measure hematological parameters annually. (  5.12  ,  6.1  ) 
 *     Genital mycotic infections : Monitor and treat if indicated.  (5.13)   
 *     Increased LDL-C : Monitor and treat per standard of care.  (5.14)   
 *     Bladder Cancer : An imbalance in bladder cancers was observed in clinical trials. Dapagliflozin should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and should be used with caution in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer.  (5.15)   
 *     Macrovascular outcomes : There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with XIGDUO XR or any other antidiabetic drug.  (5.16)   
    
 

   5.1 Lactic Acidosis



  Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with XIGDUO XR; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (&gt;5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels &gt;5 mug/mL are generally found.



 The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients &gt;=80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ,  5.3  ,  5.5  ,  5.6  ,  5.7       5.11     )  ].



 The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ]. Metformin should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.



 Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal (ULN), but &lt;5 mmol/L, in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.8)    ].



 Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).



 Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery [see   Contraindications (4)    and Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ,  5.6  ,  5.7  ,  5.10  ,  5.11  )  ].



    5.2 Hypoxic States



  Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur in patients on XIGDUO XR therapy, the drug should be promptly discontinued.



    5.3 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment



  Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Therefore, XIGDUO XR is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment [see   Contraindications (4)    ]. Also, dapagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function may be more susceptible to these changes. Adverse reactions related to renal function can occur after initiating XIGDUO XR [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].



 Before initiation of XIGDUO XR therapy, and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed and verified as normal or mildly impaired. In patients in whom development of renal impairment is anticipated (e.g., elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently and XIGDUO XR discontinued if evidence of moderate to severe renal impairment is present.



    5.4 Hypotension



  Dapagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension can occur after initiating dapagliflozin [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ], particularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics.



 Before initiating XIGDUO XR in patients with one or more of these characteristics, volume status should be assessed and corrected. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy.



    5.5 Impaired Hepatic Function



  Metformin use in patients with impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. Therefore, XIGDUO XR should generally be avoided in patients with hepatic impairment.



    5.6 Alcohol Intake



  Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving XIGDUO XR.



    5.7 Surgical Procedures



  Use of XIGDUO XR should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) and should not be restarted until the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal or mildly impaired.



    5.8 Change in Clinical Status of Patients with Previously Controlled Type 2 Diabetes



  A patient with type 2 diabetes, previously well controlled on XIGDUO XR, who develops laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness (especially vague and poorly defined illness) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis. Evaluation should include serum electrolytes and ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate, pyruvate, and metformin levels. If acidosis of either form occurs, XIGDUO XR must be stopped immediately and other appropriate corrective measures initiated.



    5.9 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia



   Dapagliflozin  



 Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. Dapagliflozin can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used in combination with XIGDUO XR.



    Metformin hydrochloride  



 Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.



    5.10 Concomitant Medications Affecting Renal Function or Metformin Disposition



  Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or may interfere with the disposition of metformin, such as cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion [see   Drug Interactions (7.3)    ], should be used with caution.



    5.11 Radiologic Studies with Intravascular Iodinated Contrast Materials



  Intravascular contrast studies with iodinated materials can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin. Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, XIGDUO XR should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure, and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal or mildly impaired.



    5.12 Vitamin B12Concentrations



  In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. This decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on XIGDUO XR and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].



 Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12measurements at 2- to 3-year intervals may be useful.



    5.13 Genital Mycotic Infections



  Dapagliflozin increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Monitor and treat appropriately.



    5.14 Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)



  Increases in LDL-C occur with dapagliflozin [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Monitor LDL-C and treat per standard of care after initiating XIGDUO XR.



    5.15 Bladder Cancer



  Across 22 clinical studies, newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer were reported in 10/6045 patients (0.17%) treated with dapagliflozin and 1/3512 patient (0.03%) treated with placebo/comparator. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 4 cases with dapagliflozin and no cases with placebo/comparator. Bladder cancer risk factors and hematuria (a potential indicator of pre-existing tumors) were balanced between treatment arms at baseline. There were too few cases to determine whether the emergence of these events is related to dapagliflozin.



 There are insufficient data to determine whether dapagliflozin has an effect on pre-existing bladder tumors. Consequently, XIGDUO XR should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer. In patients with prior history of bladder cancer, the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with XIGDUO XR should be considered.



    5.16 Macrovascular Outcomes



  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with XIGDUO XR or any other antidiabetic drug.
