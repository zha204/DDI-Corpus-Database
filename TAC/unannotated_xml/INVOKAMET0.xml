  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     Pool of Placebo-Controlled Trials  



     Canagliflozin  



 The data in Table 1 is derived from four 26-week placebo-controlled trials. In one trial canagliflozin was used as monotherapy and in three trials canagliflozin was used as add-on therapy with metformin (with or without other agents)  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . These data reflect exposure of 1667 patients to canagliflozin and a mean duration of exposure to canagliflozin of 24 weeks with 1275 patients exposed to a combination of canagliflozin and metformin. Patients received canagliflozin 100 mg (N=833), canagliflozin 300 mg (N=834) or placebo (N=646) once daily. The mean daily dose of metformin was 2138 mg (SD 337.3) for the 1275 patients in the three placebo-controlled metformin add-on studies. The mean age of the population was 56 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty percent (50%) of the population was male and 72% were Caucasian, 12% were Asian, and 5% were Black or African American. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7.3 years, had a mean HbA1C of 8.0% and 20% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired (mean eGFR 88 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ).



 Table 1 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of canagliflozin. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on canagliflozin than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either canagliflozin 100 mg or canagliflozin 300 mg.

          Abdominal pain was also more commonly reported in patients taking canagliflozin 100 mg (1.8%), 300 mg (1.7%) than in patients taking placebo (0.8%).
 

     Canagliflozin and Metformin  



 The incidence and type of adverse reactions in the three 26-week placebo-controlled metformin add-on studies, representing a majority of data from the four 26-week placebo-controlled trials, was similar to the adverse reactions described in Table 1. There were no additional adverse reactions identified in the pooling of these three placebo-controlled studies that included metformin relative to the four placebo-controlled studies.



 In a trial with canagliflozin as initial combination therapy with metformin  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  , an increased incidence of diarrhea was observed in the canagliflozin and metformin combination groups (4.2%) compared to canagliflozin or metformin monotherapy groups (1.7%).



     Pool of Placebo- and Active-Controlled Trials - Canagliflozin  



 The occurrence of adverse reactions for canagliflozin was evaluated in a larger pool of patients participating in placebo- and active-controlled trials.



 The data combined eight clinical trials and reflect exposure of 6177 patients to canagliflozin. The mean duration of exposure to canagliflozin was 38 weeks with 1832 individuals exposed to canagliflozin for greater than 50 weeks. Patients received canagliflozin 100 mg (N=3092), canagliflozin 300 mg (N=3085) or comparator (N=3262) once daily. The mean age of the population was 60 years and 5% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the population was male and 73% were Caucasian, 16% were Asian, and 4% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 11 years, had a mean HbA1C of 8.0% and 33% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired (mean eGFR 81 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ).



 The types and frequency of common adverse reactions observed in the pool of eight clinical trials were consistent with those listed in Table 1. Percentages were weighted by studies. Study weights were proportional to the harmonic mean of the three treatment sample sizes. In this pool, canagliflozin was also associated with the adverse reactions of fatigue (1.8% with comparator, 2.2% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 2.0% with canagliflozin 300 mg) and loss of strength or energy (i.e., asthenia) (0.6% with comparator, 0.7% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 1.1% with canagliflozin 300 mg).



 In the pool of eight clinical trials, the incidence rate of pancreatitis (acute or chronic) was 0.1, 0.2, and 0.1 receiving comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively.



 In the pool of eight clinical trials, hypersensitivity-related adverse reactions (including erythema, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema) occurred in 3.0%, 3.8%, and 4.2% of patients receiving comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Five patients experienced serious adverse reactions of hypersensitivity with canagliflozin, which included 4 patients with urticaria and 1 patient with a diffuse rash and urticaria occurring within hours of exposure to canagliflozin. Among these patients, 2 patients discontinued canagliflozin. One patient with urticaria had recurrence when canagliflozin was re-initiated.



 Photosensitivity-related adverse reactions (including photosensitivity reaction, polymorphic light eruption, and sunburn) occurred in 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.2% of patients receiving comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively.



 Other adverse reactions occurring more frequently on canagliflozin than on comparator were:



     Volume Depletion-Related Adverse Reactions  



 Canagliflozin results in an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to reductions in intravascular volume. In clinical studies, treatment with canagliflozin was associated with a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of volume depletion-related adverse reactions (e.g., hypotension, postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and dehydration). An increased incidence was observed in patients on the 300 mg dose. The three factors associated with the largest increase in volume depletion-related adverse reactions were the use of loop diuretics, moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ), and age 75 years and older (Table 2)  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ,  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  , and  Use in Specific Populations (8.5  ,  8.6)  ]  .

              Falls  
 

 In a pool of nine clinical trials with mean duration of exposure to canagliflozin of 85 weeks, the proportion of patients who experienced falls was 1.3%, 1.5%, and 2.1% with comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. The higher risk of falls for patients treated with canagliflozin was observed within the first few weeks of treatment.



     Impairment in Renal Function  



 Canagliflozin is associated with a dose-dependent increase in serum creatinine and a concomitant fall in estimated GFR (Table 3). Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline had larger mean changes.

            In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials where patients had normal or mildly impaired baseline renal function, the proportion of patients who experienced at least one event of significant renal function decline, defined as an eGFR below 80 mL/min/1.73 m  2  and 30% lower than baseline, was 2.1% with placebo, 2.0% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 4.1% with canagliflozin 300 mg. At the end of treatment, 0.5% with placebo, 0.7% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 1.4% with canagliflozin 300 mg had a significant renal function decline.
 

 In a trial carried out in patients with moderate renal impairment with a baseline eGFR of 30 to less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m  2  (mean baseline eGFR 39 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ), the proportion of patients who experienced at least one event of significant renal function decline, defined as an eGFR 30% lower than baseline, was 6.9% with placebo, 18% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 22.5% with canagliflozin 300 mg. At the end of treatment, 4.6% with placebo, 3.4% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 2.2% with canagliflozin 300 mg had a significant renal function decline.



 In a pooled population of patients with moderate renal impairment (N=1085) with baseline eGFR of 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  (mean baseline eGFR 48 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ), the overall incidence of these events was lower than in the dedicated trial but a dose-dependent increase in incident episodes of significant renal function decline compared to placebo was still observed. Use of canagliflozin has been associated with an increased incidence of renal-related adverse reactions (e.g., increased blood creatinine, decreased glomerular filtration rate, renal impairment, and acute renal failure), particularly in patients with moderate renal impairment.



 In the pooled analysis of patients with moderate renal impairment, the incidence of renal-related adverse reactions was 3.7% with placebo, 8.9% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 9.3% with canagliflozin 300 mg. Discontinuations due to renal-related adverse events occurred in 1.0% with placebo, 1.2% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 1.6% with canagliflozin 300 mg  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ].  



     Genital Mycotic Infections  



 In the pool of four placebo-controlled clinical trials, female genital mycotic infections (e.g., vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and vulvovaginitis) occurred in 2.8%, 10.6%, and 11.6% of females treated with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections on canagliflozin. Female patients who developed genital mycotic infections on canagliflozin were more likely to experience recurrence and require treatment with oral or topical antifungal agents and anti-microbial agents. In females, discontinuation due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.7% of patients treated with placebo and canagliflozin, respectively  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.8)  ]  .



 In the pool of four placebo-controlled clinical trials, male genital mycotic infections (e.g., candidal balanitis, balanoposthitis) occurred in 0.7%, 4.2%, and 3.8% of males treated with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Male genital mycotic infections occurred more commonly in uncircumcised males and in males with a prior history of balanitis or balanoposthitis. Male patients who developed genital mycotic infections on canagliflozin were more likely to experience recurrent infections (22% on canagliflozin versus none on placebo), and require treatment with oral or topical antifungal agents and anti-microbial agents than patients on comparators. In males, discontinuations due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo and canagliflozin, respectively. In the pooled analysis of 8 controlled trials, phimosis was reported in 0.3% of uncircumcised male patients treated with canagliflozin and 0.2% required circumcision to treat the phimosis  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.8)  ]  .



     Hypoglycemia  



 In canagliflozin clinical trials, hypoglycemia was defined as any event regardless of symptoms, where biochemical hypoglycemia was documented (any glucose value below or equal to 70 mg/dL). Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event consistent with hypoglycemia where the patient required the assistance of another person to recover, lost consciousness, or experienced a seizure (regardless of whether biochemical documentation of a low glucose value was obtained). In individual clinical trials  [see  Clinical Studies (14.6)  ]  , episodes of hypoglycemia occurred at a higher rate when canagliflozin was co-administered with insulin or sulfonylureas (Table 4)  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.7)  ]  .

              Bone Fracture  
 

 The occurrence of bone fractures was evaluated in a pool of nine clinical trials with a mean duration of exposure to canagliflozin of 85 weeks. The incidence rates of adjudicated bone fractures were 1.1, 1.4, and 1.5 per 100 patient-years of exposure in the comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg groups, respectively. Fractures were observed as early as 12 weeks after treatment initiation and were more likely to be low trauma (e.g., fall from no more than standing height), and affect the upper extremities  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.10)  ]  .



     Metformin  



 The most common adverse reactions (5% or greater incidence) due to initiation of metformin are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.



 Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12, which may very rarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12deficiency (e.g., megaloblastic anemia)  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.12)  ]  .



     Laboratory and Imaging Tests  



     Increases in Serum Potassium  



 In a pooled population of patients (N=723) with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ), increases in serum potassium to greater than 5.4 mEq/L and 15% above baseline occurred in 5.3%, 5.0%, and 8.8% of patients treated with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Severe elevations (greater than or equal to 6.5 mEq/L) occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with placebo, no patients treated with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 1.3% of patients treated with canagliflozin 300 mg.



 In these patients, increases in potassium were more commonly seen in those with elevated potassium at baseline. Among patients with moderate renal impairment, approximately 84% were taking medications that interfere with potassium excretion, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-receptor blockers  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2  ,  5.5)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ].  



     Increases in Serum Magnesium  



 Dose-related increases in serum magnesium were observed early after initiation of canagliflozin (within 6 weeks) and remained elevated throughout treatment. In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials, the mean percent change in serum magnesium levels was 8.1% and 9.3% with canagliflozin 100 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively, compared to -0.6% with placebo. In a trial of patients with moderate renal impairment, serum magnesium levels increased by 0.2%, 9.2%, and 14.8% with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively.



     Increases in Serum Phosphate  



 Dose-related increases in serum phosphate levels were observed with canagliflozin. In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials, the mean percent change in serum phosphate levels were 3.6% and 5.1% with canagliflozin 100 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively, compared to 1.5% with placebo. In a trial of patients with moderate renal impairment, the mean serum phosphate levels increased by 1.2%, 5.0%, and 9.3% with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively.



     Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (non-HDL-C)  



 In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials, dose-related increases in LDL-C with canagliflozin were observed. Mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in LDL-C relative to placebo were 4.4 mg/dL (4.5%) and 8.2 mg/dL (8.0%) with canagliflozin 100 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. The mean baseline LDL-C levels were 104 to 110 mg/dL across treatment groups  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.12)  ]  .



 Dose-related increases in non-HDL-C with canagliflozin were observed. Mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in non-HDL-C relative to placebo were 2.1 mg/dL (1.5%) and 5.1 mg/dL (3.6%) with canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively. The mean baseline non-HDL-C levels were 140 to 147 mg/dL across treatment groups.



     Increases in Hemoglobin  



 In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials, mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in hemoglobin were -0.18 g/dL (-1.1%) with placebo, 0.47 g/dL (3.5%) with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 0.51 g/dL (3.8%) with canagliflozin 300 mg. The mean baseline hemoglobin value was approximately 14.1 g/dL across treatment groups. At the end of treatment, 0.8%, 4.0%, and 2.7% of patients treated with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively, had hemoglobin levels above the upper limit of normal.



     Decreases in Bone Mineral Density  



 Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in a clinical trial of 714 older adults (mean age 64 years). At 2 years, patients randomized to canagliflozin 100 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg had placebo-corrected declines in BMD at the total hip of 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively, and at the lumbar spine of 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively.



 Additionally, placebo-adjusted BMD declines were 0.1% at the femoral neck for both canagliflozin doses and 0.4% at the distal forearm for patients randomized to canagliflozin 300 mg. The placebo-adjusted change at the distal forearm for patients randomized to canagliflozin 100 mg was 0%.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of canagliflozin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   5.1 Lactic Acidosis



  There have been post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (&gt;5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally &gt;5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.



 If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of INVOKAMET XR. In INVOKAMET XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.



 Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue INVOKAMET XR and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.



 For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:



    Renal Impairment:  The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  



 *  Before initiating INVOKAMET XR, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 
 *  INVOKAMET XR is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/minute/1.73 m  2  . 
 *  Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking INVOKAMET XR. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. 
       Drug Interactions:  The concomitant use of INVOKAMET XR with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation (e.g. cationic drugs) [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ].  Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.
 

    Age 65 or Greater:  The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.5)  ].  



    Radiological Studies with Contrast:  Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop INVOKAMET XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart INVOKAMET XR if renal function is stable.



    Surgery and Other Procedures:  Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment.



 INVOKAMET XR should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.



    Hypoxic States:  Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause pre-renal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue INVOKAMET XR.



    Excessive Alcohol Intake:  Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving INVOKAMET XR.



    Hepatic Impairment:  Patients with hepatic impairment have developed metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of INVOKAMET XR in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.



    5.2 Hypotension



  Canagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension can occur after initiating INVOKAMET XR [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  particularly in patients with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  , elderly patients, patients on either diuretics or medications that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., angiotensin-converting-enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), or patients with low systolic blood pressure. Before initiating INVOKAMET XR in patients with one or more of these characteristics who were not already on canagliflozin, volume status should be assessed and corrected. Monitor for signs and symptoms after initiating therapy.



    5.3 Ketoacidosis



  Reports of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including canagliflozin. Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking canagliflozin. INVOKAMET XR is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [see  Indications and Usage (1)  ]  .



 Patients treated with INVOKAMET XR who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels, as ketoacidosis associated with INVOKAMET XR may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg/dL. If ketoacidosis is suspected, INVOKAMET XR should be discontinued, patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin, fluid and carbohydrate replacement.



 In many of the postmarketing reports, and particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes, the presence of ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (often less than 250 mg/dL). Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. In some but not all cases, factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as insulin dose reduction, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake due to illness or surgery, pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g., type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse were identified.



 Before initiating INVOKAMET XR consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause, caloric restriction, and alcohol abuse. In patients treated with INVOKAMET XR consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing INVOKAMET XR in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g., prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery).



    5.4 Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function



  Canagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  and can cause renal impairment [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients receiving canagliflozin; some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age.



 Before initiating INVOKAMET XR, consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury including hypovolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, and concomitant medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs). Consider temporarily discontinuing INVOKAMET XR in any setting of reduced oral intake (such as acute illness or fasting) or fluid losses (such as gastrointestinal illness or excessive heat exposure); monitor patients for signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue INVOKAMET XR promptly and institute treatment.



 Canagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Patients with hypovolemia may be more susceptible to these changes. Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating INVOKAMET XR [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of INVOKAMET XR and monitored periodically thereafter. Dosage adjustment and more frequent renal function monitoring are recommended in patients with an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  . INVOKAMET XR is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m  2   [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ,  Contraindications (4)  ,  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ].  



    5.5 Hyperkalemia



  Canagliflozin can lead to hyperkalemia. Patients with moderate renal impairment who are taking medications that interfere with potassium excretion, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, or medications that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are at an increased risk of developing hyperkalemia [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 Monitor serum potassium levels periodically after initiating INVOKAMET XR in patients with impaired renal function and in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia due to medications or other medical conditions.



    5.6 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis



  There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including canagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



    5.7 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Sulfonylurea or Insulin



   Canagliflozin  



 Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. Canagliflozin can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with INVOKAMET XR.



    Metformin  



 Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication, are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Monitor for a need to lower the dose of INVOKAMET XR to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in these patients.



    5.8 Genital Mycotic Infections



  Canagliflozin increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections and uncircumcised males were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor and treat appropriately.



    5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have been reported with canagliflozin. These reactions generally occurred within hours to days after initiating canagliflozin. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of INVOKAMET XR; treat and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  ]  .



    5.10 Bone Fracture



  An increased risk of bone fracture, occurring as early as 12 weeks after treatment initiation, was observed in patients using canagliflozin. Consider factors that contribute to fracture risk prior to initiating INVOKAMET XR [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.11 Vitamin B12Levels



  In controlled, 29-week clinical trials of metformin, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of metformin-treated patients. Such decreases, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia or neurologic manifestations due to the short duration (less than 1 year) of the clinical trials. This risk may be more relevant to patients receiving long-term treatment with metformin and adverse hematologic and neurologic reactions have been reported postmarketing. The decrease in vitamin B12levels appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis in patients on INVOKAMET XR and investigate and treat if abnormalities occur. Patients with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption may be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels, and routine serum vitamin B12measurement at 2- to 3-year intervals is recommended in these patients.



    5.12 Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL-C)



  Dose-related increases in LDL-C occur with canagliflozin [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor LDL-C and treat if appropriate after initiating INVOKAMET XR.



    5.13 Macrovascular Outcomes



  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with INVOKAMET XR or any other antidiabetic drug [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .
