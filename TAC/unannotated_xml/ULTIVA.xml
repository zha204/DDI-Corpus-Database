    <Section name="adverse reactions" id="S1">    ADVERSE EVENTS

  ULTIVA produces adverse events that are characteristic of u-opioids, such as respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, and skeletal muscle rigidity. These adverse events dissipate within minutes of discontinuing or decreasing the infusion rate of ULTIVA. See  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ,  WARNINGS  , and  PRECAUTIONS  on the management of these events.



 Adverse event information is derived from controlled clinical trials that were conducted in a variety of surgical procedures of varying duration, using a variety of premedications and other anesthetics, and in patient populations with diverse characteristics including underlying disease.



   Adults

  Approximately 2770 adult patients were exposed to ULTIVA in controlled clinical trials. The frequencies of adverse events during general anesthesia with the recommended doses of ULTIVA are given in Table 3. Each patient was counted once for each type of adverse event.



 Table 3: Adverse Events Reported in &gt;=1% of Adult Patients in General Anesthesia StudiesDoes not include adverse events from cardiac studies or the neonatal study. See Tables 6, 7, and 8 for cardiac information. at the Recommended DosesSee Table 10 for recommended doses. Not all doses of ULTIVA were equipotent to the comparator opioid. Administration of ULTIVA in excess of the recommended dose (i.e., doses &gt;1 and up to 20 mcg/kg) resulted in a higher incidence of some adverse events: muscle rigidity (37%), bradycardia (12%), hypertension (4%), and tachycardia (4%). of ULTIVA

            Other Adverse Events in Adult Patients
   The frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events from all controlled general anesthesia and monitored anesthesia care studies are presented below.



 Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who were administered ULTIVA and reported an event divided by the total number of patients exposed to ULTIVA in all controlled studies including cardiac dose-ranging and neurosurgery studies (n = 1883 general anesthesia, n = 609 monitored anesthesia care).



       Incidence Less than 1%    

      Digestive:    constipation, abdominal discomfort, xerostomia, gastro-esophageal reflux, dysphagia, diarrhea, heartburn, ileus.

     Respiratory:    cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, rhonchi, stridor, nasal congestion, pharyngitis, pleural effusion, hiccup(s), pulmonary edema, rales, bronchitis, rhinorrhea.



     Nervous:    anxiety, involuntary movement, prolonged emergence from anesthesia, confusion, awareness under anesthesia without pain, rapid awakening from anesthesia, tremors, disorientation, dysphoria, nightmare(s), hallucinations, paresthesia, nystagmus, twitch, sleep disorder, seizure, amnesia.



     Body as a Whole:    decreased body temperature, anaphylactic reaction, delayed recovery from neuromuscular block.



     Skin:    rash, urticaria.



     Urogenital:    urine retention, oliguria, dysuria, urine incontinence.



     Infusion Site Reaction:    erythema, pruritus, rash.



     Metabolic and Nutrition:    abnormal liver function, hyperglycemia, electrolyte disorders, increased CPK level.

 The frequencies of adverse events from the clinical studies at the recommended doses of ULTIVA in cardiac surgery are given in Tables 6, 7, and 8. These tables represent adverse events collected during discrete phases of cardiac surgery. Any event should be viewed as temporally associated with drug administration and the phase indicated should not be perceived as the only time the event might occur.

            Pediatrics
   ULTIVA has been studied in 342 pediatric patients in controlled clinical trials for maintenance of general anesthesia. In the pediatric population (birth to 12 years), the most commonly reported events were nausea, vomiting, and shivering.



 The frequencies of adverse events during general anesthesia with the recommended doses of ULTIVA are given in Table 9. Each patient was counted once for each type of adverse event. There were no adverse events &gt;=1% for any treatment group during the maintenance period in the pediatric patient general anesthesia studies.

               Observed During Clinical Practice
   In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of remifentanil in conjunction with one or more anesthetic agents in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to remifentanil.



     Cardiovascular:    Asystole.



     Non-Site Specific:    Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid responses, which in some cases have been severe (e.g., shock).
