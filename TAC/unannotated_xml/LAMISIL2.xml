  6.1     Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The most frequently reported adverse events observed in the 3 US/Canadian placebo-controlled trials are listed in the table below. The adverse events reported encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain), liver test abnormalities, rashes, urticaria, pruritus, and taste disturbances. Changes in the ocular lens and retina have been reported following the use of Lamisil Tablets in controlled trials. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown. In general, the adverse events were mild, transient, and did not lead to discontinuation from study participation.

             6.2     Postmarketing Experience
   The following adverse events have been identified during postapproval use of Lamisil Tablets. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Blood and lymphatic system disorders:  Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5     WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Liver failure, sometimes leading to liver transplant or death, has occurred with the use of oral terbinafine. Obtain pretreatment serum transaminases.  Discontinue Lamisil Tablets if liver injury develops. (  5.1  ,  5.8  ) 
 *  Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of Lamisil Tablets. Taste disturbance can be severe, may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue Lamisil Tablets if taste disturbance occurs. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of Lamisil Tablets. Smell disturbance may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue Lamisil Tablets if smell disturbance occurs. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Depressive symptoms have been reported with terbinafine use. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Severe neutropenia has been reported. If the neutrophil count is &lt; 1000 cells/mm  3  , Lamisil Tablets should be discontinued. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with oral terbinafine use. If signs or symptoms of drug reaction occur, treatment with Lamisil Tablets should be discontinued. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1     Hepatotoxicity



  Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of Lamisil Tablets in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease.



 In the majority of liver cases reported in association with use of Lamisil Tablets, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with Lamisil Tablets should be discontinued if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops.



 Lamisil Tablets are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing Lamisil Tablets, liver function tests should be performed since hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Periodic monitoring of liver function tests is recommended. Lamisil should be immediately discontinued in case of elevation of liver function tests. Patients prescribed Lamisil Tablets should be warned to report immediately to their physician any symptoms of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Patients with these symptoms should discontinue taking oral terbinafine, and the patient's liver function should be immediately evaluated.



    5.2     Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste



  Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of Lamisil Tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than 1 year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, Lamisil Tablets should be discontinued.



    5.3     Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell



  Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of Lamisil Tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than 1 year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, Lamisil Tablets should be discontinued.



    5.4     Depressive Symptoms



  Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of Lamisil Tablets. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician.



    5.5     Hematologic Effects



  Transient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) have been observed in controlled clinical trials. In placebo-controlled trials, 8/465 subjects receiving Lamisil Tablets (1.7%) and 3/137 subjects receiving placebo (2.2%) had decreases in ALC to below 1000/mm  3  on 2 or more occasions. In patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency, physicians should consider monitoring complete blood counts if treatment continues for more than 6 weeks. Cases of severe neutropenia have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of Lamisil Tablets, with or without supportive therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of secondary infection occur, a complete blood count should be obtained. If the neutrophil count is &lt;=1000 cells/mm  3  , Lamisil Tablets should be discontinued and supportive management started.



    5.6     Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions



  There have been postmarketing reports of serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome]. Manifestations of DRESS syndrome may include cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more organ complications such as hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. If progressive skin rash or signs/symptoms of the above drug reactions occur, treatment with Lamisil Tablets should be discontinued.



    5.7     Lupus Erythematosus



  During postmarketing experience, precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking Lamisil Tablets. Lamisil Tablets should be discontinued in patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of lupus erythematosus.



    5.8     Laboratory Monitoring



  Measurement of serum transaminases (ALT and AST) is advised for all patients before taking Lamisil Tablets.
