  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and durations of follow up, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Plavix has been evaluated for safety in more than 54,000 patients, including over 21,000 patients treated for 1 year or more. The clinically important adverse reactions observed in trials comparing Plavix plus aspirin to placebo plus aspirin and trials comparing Plavix alone to aspirin alone are discussed below.



     Bleeding    



   CURE  



 In CURE, Plavix use with aspirin was associated with an increase in major bleeding (primarily gastrointestinal and at puncture sites) compared to placebo with aspirin (see Table 1). The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (0.1%) and fatal bleeding (0.2%) were the same in both groups. Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the clopidogrel group were epistaxis, hematuria, and bruise.



 The overall incidence of bleeding is described in Table 1.

          Ninety-two percent (92%) of the patients in the CURE study received heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and the rate of bleeding in these patients was similar to the overall results.
 

   COMMIT  



 In COMMIT, similar rates of major bleeding were observed in the Plavix and placebo groups, both of which also received aspirin (see Table 2).

            CAPRIE (Plavix vs. Aspirin)  
 

 In CAPRIE, gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred at a rate of 2.0% in those taking Plavix vs. 2.7% in those taking aspirin; bleeding requiring hospitalization occurred in 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.4% for Plavix compared to 0.5% for aspirin.



 Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the Plavix group were epistaxis and hematoma.



 Other Adverse Events



 In CURE and CHARISMA, which compared Plavix plus aspirin to aspirin alone, there was no difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) between Plavix and placebo.



 In CAPRIE, which compared Plavix to aspirin, pruritus was more frequently reported in those taking Plavix. No other difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) was reported.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Plavix. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *   Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia/pancytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) 
 *   Gastrointestinal disorders: Gastrointestinal and retroperitoneal hemorrhage with fatal outcome, colitis (including ulcerative or lymphocytic colitis), pancreatitis, stomatitis 
 *   General disorders and administration site condition : Fever, hemorrhage of operative wound 
 *   Hepato-biliary disorders: Acute liver failure, hepatitis (non-infectious), abnormal liver function test 
 *   Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reactions, serum sickness 
 *   Musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders: Musculoskeletal bleeding, myalgia, arthralgia, arthritis 
 *   Nervous system disorders : Taste disorders, fatal intracranial bleeding 
 *   Eye disorders : Eye (conjunctival, ocular, retinal) bleeding 
 *   Psychiatric disorders: Confusion, hallucinations 
 *   Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Bronchospasm, interstitial pneumonitis, respiratory tract bleeding

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: DIMINISHED EFFECTIVENESS IN POOR METABOLIZERS

  WARNING: DIMINISHED EFFECTIVENESS IN POOR METABOLIZERS

      The effectiveness of Plavix is dependent on its activation to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally CYP2C19   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  . Plavix at recommended doses forms less of that metabolite and has a smaller effect on platelet function in patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. Poor metabolizers with acute coronary syndrome or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention treated with Plavix at recommended doses exhibit higher cardiovascular event rates than do patients with normal CYP2C19 function. Tests are available to identify a patient's CYP2C19 genotype; these tests can be used as an aid in determining therapeutic strategy   [see   Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)  ]  . Consider alternative treatment or treatment strategies in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers   [see   Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .

    BOXED WARNING: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES

  14 CLINICAL STUDIES

  The clinical evidence of the efficacy of Plavix is derived from three double-blind trials involving 77,599 patients. The CAPRIE study (Clopidogrel vs. Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) was a comparison of Plavix to aspirin. The CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Ischemic Events) and the COMMIT/CCS-2 (Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction Trial / Second Chinese Cardiac Study) studies were comparisons of Plavix to placebo, given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy. The CHARISMA (Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance) study (n=15,603) also compared Plavix to placebo, given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy.



   14.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome 

      CURE    



 The CURE study included 12,562 patients with ACS without ST-elevation (UA or NSTEMI) and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischemia. Patients were required to have either ECG changes compatible with new ischemia (without ST-elevation) or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or T to at least twice the upper limit of normal. The patient population was largely Caucasian (82%) and included 38% women, and 52% patients &gt;=65 years of age.



 Patients were randomized to receive Plavix (300-mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily) or placebo, and were treated for up to one year. Patients also received aspirin (75-325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies such as heparin. The use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors was not permitted for three days prior to randomization.



 The number of patients experiencing the primary outcome (CV death, MI, or stroke) was 582 (9.3%) in the Plavix-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the placebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10%-28%; p &lt; 0.001) for the Plavix-treated group (see   Table 4  ).

   MI                                324       (5.2%)            419 (6.6%)            23% (11.0, 33.4)       
   Stroke                             75       (1.2%)             87 (1.4%)            14% (-17.7, 36.6)      
          Most of the benefit of Plavix occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see   Figure 1  ).
 

     Figure 1: Cardiovascular Death, Myocardial Infarction, and Stroke in the CURE Study   



 



   In CURE, the use of Plavix was associated with a lower incidence of CV death, MI or stroke in patient populations with different characteristics, as shown in Figure 2. The benefits associated with Plavix were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors. The efficacy of Plavix was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75-325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, non-study anti-platelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.



     Figure 2: Hazard Ratio for Patient Baseline Characteristics and On-Study Concomitant Medications/Interventions for the CURE Study   



 



   The use of Plavix in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the Plavix group, 126 patients [2.0%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the Plavix group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of Plavix in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting), (2253 patients [36.0%] in the Plavix group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%).



     COMMIT    



 In patients with STEMI, the safety and efficacy of Plavix were evaluated in the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, COMMIT. COMMIT included 45,852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of the symptoms of myocardial infarction with supporting ECG abnormalities (  i.e.  , ST-elevation, ST-depression or left bundle-branch block). Patients were randomized to receive Plavix (75 mg once daily) or placebo, in combination with aspirin (162 mg per day), for 28 days or until hospital discharge, whichever came first.



 The primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of re-infarction, stroke or death. 



 The patient population included 28% women, 58% age &gt;= 60 years (26% age &gt;= 70 years), 55% patients who received thrombolytics, 68% who received ACE-inhibitors, and only 3% who underwent PCI.



 As shown in Table 5 and Figures 3 and 4 below, Plavix significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7% (p=0.029), and the relative risk of the combination of re-infarction, stroke or death by 9% (p=0.002).

 Composite endpoint: Death, MI, or StrokeThe difference between the composite endpoint and the sum of death+non-fatal MI+non-fatal stroke indicates that 9 patients (2 clopidogrel and 7 placebo) suffered both a non-fatal stroke and a non-fatal MI.     2121 (9.2%)         2310 (10.1%)     0.91 (0.86, 0.97)         0.002

   The effect of Plavix did not differ significantly in various pre-specified subgroups as shown in Figure 5. The effect was also similar in non-prespecified subgroups including those based on infarct location, Killip class or prior MI history (see Figure 6). Such subgroup analyses should be interpreted cautiously.

   14.2 Recent Myocardial Infarction, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease

      CAPRIE    



 The CAPRIE trial was a 19,185-patient, 304-center, international, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study comparing Plavix (75 mg daily) to aspirin (325 mg daily). The patients randomized had: 1) recent histories of myocardial infarction (within 35 days); 2) recent histories of ischemic stroke (within 6 months) with at least a week of residual neurological signs; or 3) established peripheral arterial disease. Patients received randomized treatment for an average of 1.6 years (maximum of 3 years).



 The trial's primary outcome was the time to first occurrence of new ischemic stroke (fatal or not), new myocardial infarction (fatal or not), or other vascular death. Deaths not easily attributable to nonvascular causes were all classified as vascular.



 Table 6: Outcome Events in the CAPRIE Primary Analysis 
                                                       Plavix                         aspirin

 Ischemic stroke (fatal or not)                      438 (4.6%)                      461 (4.8%)             
 MI (fatal or not)                                   275 (2.9%)                      333 (3.5%)             
 Other vascular death                                226 (2.4%)                      226 (2.4%)             
 Total                                               939 (9.8%)                     1020 (10.6%)            
         As shown in the table, Plavix was associated with a lower incidence of outcome events, primarily MI. The overall relative risk reduction (9.8% vs. 10.6%) was 8.7%, p=0.045. Similar results were obtained when all-cause mortality and all-cause strokes were counted instead of vascular mortality and ischemic strokes (risk reduction 6.9%). In patients who survived an on-study stroke or myocardial infarction, the incidence of subsequent events was lower in the Plavix group.
 

 The curves showing the overall event rate are shown in Figure 7. The event curves separated early and continued to diverge over the 3-year follow-up period.



     Figure 7: Fatal or Non-Fatal Vascular Events in the CAPRIE Study  



 



   The statistical significance favoring Plavix over aspirin was marginal (p=0.045). However, because aspirin is itself effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke, the effect of Plavix is substantial.



 The CAPRIE trial included a population that was randomized on the basis of 3 entry criteria. The efficacy of Plavix relative to aspirin was heterogeneous across these randomized subgroups (p=0.043). It is not clear whether this difference is real or a chance occurrence. Although the CAPRIE trial was not designed to evaluate the relative benefit of Plavix over aspirin in the individual patient subgroups, the benefit appeared to be strongest in patients who were enrolled because of peripheral vascular disease (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) and weaker in stroke patients. In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial infarction, Plavix was not numerically superior to aspirin.



   14.3 Lack of Established Benefit of Plavix plus Aspirin in Patients with Multiple Risk Factors or Established Vascular Disease

   CHARISMA 



 The CHARISMA trial was a 15,603 subject, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study comparing Plavix (75 mg daily) to placebo for prevention of ischemic events in patients with vascular disease or multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis. All subjects were treated with aspirin 75-162 mg daily. The mean duration of treatment was 23 months. The study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the occurrence of the primary endpoint, a composite of CV death, MI, or stroke. A total of 534 (6.9%) patients in the Plavix group versus 573 (7.4%) patients in the placebo group experienced a primary outcome event (p=0.22). Bleeding of all severities was more common in the subjects randomized to Plavix.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Reduced effectiveness in impaired CYP2C19 function: Avoid concomitant use with drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole). (  5.1  ) 
 *  Bleeding: Plavix increases risk of bleeding. Discontinue 5 days prior to elective surgery. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Discontinuation of Plavix: Premature discontinuation increases risk of cardiovascular events. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Recent transient ischemic attack or stroke: Combination use of Plavix and aspirin in these patients was not shown to be more effective than Plavix alone, but was shown to increase major bleeding. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported with Plavix, including fatal cases. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity Due to Impaired CYP2C19 Function



   Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see Boxed Warning]  and by concomitant medications that interfere with CYP2C19. Avoid concomitant use of Plavix and drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 activity. Co-administration of Plavix with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor that is an inhibitor of CYP2C19, reduces the pharmacological activity of Plavix if given concomitantly or if given 12 hours apart [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .  



    5.2 General Risk of Bleeding



   Thienopyridines, including Plavix, increase the risk of bleeding. If a patient is to undergo surgery and an antiplatelet effect is not desired, discontinue Plavix 5 days prior to surgery. In patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to CABG the rates of major bleeding were similar (event rate 4.4% Plavix + aspirin; 5.3% placebo + aspirin). In patients who remained on therapy within five days of CABG, the major bleeding rate was 9.6% for Plavix + aspirin, and 6.3% for placebo + aspirin.  



  Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7-10 days), so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a bleeding event or the risk of bleeding associated with an invasive procedure. Because the half-life of clopidogrel's active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.  



    5.3 Discontinuation of Plavix



   Avoid lapses in therapy, and if Plavix must be temporarily discontinued, restart as soon as possible. Premature discontinuation of Plavix may increase the risk of cardiovascular events.  



    5.4 Patients with Recent Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke



  In patients with recent TIA or stroke who are at high risk for recurrent ischemic events, the combination of aspirin and Plavix has not been shown to be more effective than Plavix alone, but the combination has been shown to increase major bleeding.



    5.5 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)



  TTP, sometimes fatal, has been reported following use of Plavix, sometimes after a short exposure (&lt;2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). It is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragmented RBCs] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .
