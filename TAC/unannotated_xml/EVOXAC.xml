  Cevimeline was administered to 1777 patients during clinical trials worldwide, including Sjogren's patients and patients with other conditions. In placebo-controlled Sjogren's studies in the U.S., 320 patients received cevimeline doses ranging from 15 mg tid to 60 mg tid, of whom 93% were women and 7% were men. Demographic distribution was 90% Caucasian, 5% Hispanic, 3% Black and 2% of other origin. In these studies, 14.6% of patients discontinued treatment with cevimeline due to adverse events.



 The following adverse events associated with muscarinic agonism were observed in the clinical trials of cevimeline in Sjogren's syndrome patients:

   The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of EVOXAC(r). Because post-marketing adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
