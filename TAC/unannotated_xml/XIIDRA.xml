  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In five clinical studies of dry eye disease conducted with lifitegrast ophthalmic solution, 1401 patients received at least 1 dose of lifitegrast (1287 of which received lifitegrast 5%). The majority of patients (84%) had &lt;=3 months of treatment exposure. 170 patients were exposed to lifitegrast for approximately 12 months. The majority of the treated patients were female (77%). The most common adverse reactions reported in 5-25 % of patients were instillation site irritation, dysgeusia and reduced visual acuity.



 Other adverse reactions reported in 1% to 5% of the patients were blurred vision, conjunctival hyperemia, eye irritation, headache, increased lacrimation, eye discharge, eye discomfort, eye pruritus and sinusitis.
