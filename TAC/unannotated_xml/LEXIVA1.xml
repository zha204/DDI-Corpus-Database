    *  Severe or life-threatening skin reactions have been reported with the use of LEXIVA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].  
 *  The most common moderate to severe adverse reactions in clinical studies of LEXIVA were diarrhea, rash, nausea, vomiting, and headache. 
 *  Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 6.4% of patients receiving LEXIVA and in 5.9% of patients receiving comparator treatments. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of LEXIVA (incidence &lt;=1% of patients) included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, AST increased, ALT increased, and rash. 
   *  In adults the most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;=4%) are diarrhea, rash, nausea, vomiting, headache. (6.1) 
 *  Vomiting was more frequent in pediatrics than in adults. (6.1) 
      EXCERPT:     To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact  GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249  or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch    
 

 

  6.1 Clinical Trials

    Adults  



   The data for the 3 active-controlled clinical trials described below reflect exposure of 700 HIV-1 infected patients to LEXIVA Tablets, including 599 patients exposed to LEXIVA for &gt;24 weeks, and 409 patients exposed for &gt;48 weeks. The population age ranged from 17 to 72 years. Of these patients, 26% were female, 51% Caucasian, 31% black, 16% American Hispanic, and 70% were antiretroviral-naive. Sixty-one percent received LEXIVA 1,400 mg once daily plus ritonavir 200 mg once daily, 24% received LEXIVA 1,400 mg twice daily, and 15% received LEXIVA 700 mg twice daily plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily.



 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 Selected adverse reactions reported during the clinical efficacy studies of LEXIVA are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Each table presents adverse reactions of moderate or severe intensity in patients treated with combination therapy for up to 48 weeks.

 Skin rash (without regard to causality) occurred in approximately 19% of patients treated with LEXIVA in the pivotal efficacy studies. Rashes were usually maculopapular and of mild or moderate intensity, some with pruritus. Rash had a median onset of 11 days after initiation of LEXIVA and had a median duration of 13 days. Skin rash led to discontinuation of LEXIVA in &lt;1% of patients. In some patients with mild or moderate rash, dosing with LEXIVA was often continued without interruption; if interrupted, reintroduction of LEXIVA generally did not result in rash recurrence.



 The percentages of patients with Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities in the clinical efficacy studies of LEXIVA are presented in Tables 4 and 5.

   Pediatric Patients:  LEXIVA with and without ritonavir was studied in 144 pediatric patients 2 to 18 years of age in 2 open-label studies. Safety information from 75 pediatric patients receiving LEXIVA twice daily with or without ritonavir follows.



 All adverse events regardless of causality, all drug-related adverse events, and all laboratory events occurred with similar frequency in pediatrics compared with adults, with the exception of vomiting. Vomiting, regardless of causality, occurred more frequently among pediatric patients receiving LEXIVA twice daily with ritonavir ([30%] all between 2 and 18 years of age) and without ritonavir ([56%] all between 2 and 5 years of age) compared with adults receiving LEXIVA twice daily with ritonavir (10%) and without ritonavir (16%). The median duration of drug-related vomiting episodes was 1 day (range: 1 to 62 days). Vomiting required temporary dose interruptions in 4 pediatric patients and was treatment-limiting in 1 pediatric patient, all of whom were receiving LEXIVA twice daily with ritonavir.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following reactions have been identified during post-approval use of LEXIVA. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to LEXIVA.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Certain drugs should not be coadministered with LEXIVA due to risk of serious or life-threatening adverse reactions. (5.1) 
 *  LEXIVA should be discontinued for severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. (5.2) LEXIVA should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. (5.3) 
 *  Use of higher than approved doses may lead to transaminase elevations. Patients with hepatitis B or C are at increased risk of transaminase elevations. (5.4) 
 *  Patients receiving LEXIVA may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia (5.5), immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6), redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7), and elevated triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations (5.8). Monitor cholesterol and triglycerides prior to therapy and periodically thereafter. 
 *  Acute hemolytic anemia has been reported with amprenavir. (5.9) 
 *  Hemophilia: Spontaneous bleeding may occur, and additional factor VIII may be required. (5.10) 
 *  Nephrolithiasis: Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with fosamprenavir. (5.11) 
    
 

    5.1  Drug Interactions



  See Table 1 for listings of drugs that are contraindicated due to potentially life-threatening adverse events, significant drug interactions, or due to loss of virologic activity [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.2)]  .



     5.2  Skin Reactions



  Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including 1 case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome among 700 patients treated with LEXIVA in clinical studies. Treatment with LEXIVA should be discontinued for severe or life-threatening rashes and for moderate rashes accompanied by systemic symptoms [see Adverse Reactions (6)]  .



     5.3  Sulfa Allergy



  LEXIVA should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. Fosamprenavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. The potential for cross-sensitivity between drugs in the sulfonamide class and fosamprenavir is unknown. In a clinical study of LEXIVA used as the sole protease inhibitor, rash occurred in 2 of 10 patients (20%) with a history of sulfonamide allergy compared with 42 of 126 patients (33%) with no history of sulfonamide allergy. In 2 clinical studies of LEXIVA plus low-dose ritonavir, rash occurred in 8 of 50 patients (16%) with a history of sulfonamide allergy compared with 50 of 412 patients (12%) with no history of sulfonamide allergy.



     5.4  Hepatic Toxicity



  Use of LEXIVA with ritonavir at higher-than-recommended dosages may result in transaminase elevations and should not be used [see Dosage and Administration (2), Overdosage (10)]  . Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk for developing or worsening of transaminase elevations. Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with LEXIVA and patients should be monitored closely during treatment.



     5.5  Diabetes/Hyperglycemia



  New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between protease inhibitor therapy and these events have not been established.



     5.6  Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including LEXIVA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.



     5.7  Fat Redistribution



  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance," have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, including LEXIVA. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.



     5.8  Lipid Elevations



  Treatment with LEXIVA plus ritonavir has resulted in increases in the concentration of triglycerides and cholesterol [see Adverse Reactions (6)]  . Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating therapy with LEXIVA and at periodic intervals during therapy. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate [see Drug Interactions (7)]  .



     5.9  Hemolytic Anemia



  Acute hemolytic anemia has been reported in a patient treated with amprenavir.



     5.10  Patients With Hemophilia



  There have been reports of spontaneous bleeding in patients with hemophilia A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients, additional factor VIII was required. In many of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or restarted. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these episodes has not been established.



     5.11  Nephrolithiasis



  Cases of nephrolithiasis were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving LEXIVA.Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered.



     5.12  Resistance/Cross-Resistance



  Because the potential for HIV cross-resistance among protease inhibitors has not been fully explored, it is unknown what effect therapy with LEXIVA will have on the activity of subsequently administered protease inhibitors. LEXIVA has been studied in patients who have experienced treatment failure with protease inhibitors [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]  .
