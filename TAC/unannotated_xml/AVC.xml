  Local sensitivity reactions such as increased discomfort or a burning sensation have occasionally been reported following the use of topical sulfonamides. With the use of AVC Cream, sensitivity reactions (only local) were reported for 0.2% of the investigational patients.



 Treatment should be discontinued if either local or systemic manifestations of sulfonamide toxicity or sensitivity occur.
