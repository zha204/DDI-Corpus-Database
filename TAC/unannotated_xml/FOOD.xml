    1. Local Reactions  If a severe local reaction occurs during scratch, prick or puncture testing, WIPE OFF test antigen. Large, persistent local reactions or minor exacerbations of the patient's allergic symptoms may be treated by local cold applications and/or the use of oral antihistamines, but they should be considered a warning of possible severe systemic reactions.



   2. Systemic Reactions  With careful attention to dosage and administration, such reactions occur infrequently, but it must be remembered that allergenic extracts are highly potent in sensitive individuals and OVERDOSE could result in anaphylactic symptoms. Therefore, it is imperative that physicians administering allergenic extracts understand and be prepared for the treatment of severe reactions.Adverse reaction frequency data for allergenic extract administration for testing and treatment show that risk is low.  7, 8  It cannot be overemphasized that, under certain unpredictable combinations of circumstances, anaphylactic shock is a possibility. Other possible systemic reaction symptoms include fainting, pallor, bradycardia, hypotension, angioedema, cough, wheezing, conjunctivitis, rhinitis and urticaria.  If a systemic or anaphylactic reaction does occur, WIPE OFF test antigen, apply a tourniquet above the site of injection, if tests are performed on the arms, and inject the 1:1,000 epinephrine-hydrochloride intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the opposite arm. Loosen the tourniquet at least every 10 minutes. Do not obstruct arterial blood flow with the tourniquet.    EPINEPHRINE:    ADULT DOSAGE:  0.3 to 0.5 mL should be injected. Repeat in 5 to 10 minutes if necessary.  PEDIATRIC DOSAGE  : The usual initial dose is 0.01 mg (mL) per kg body weight or 0.3 mg (mL) per square meter of body surface area. Suggested dosage for infants to 2 years of age is 0.05 mL to 0.1 mL; for children 2 to 6 years, 0.15 mL; and children 6 to 12 years, 0.2 mL. Single pediatric doses should not exceed 0.3 mg (mL). Doses may be repeated as frequently as every 20 minutes, depending on the severity of the condition and the response of the patient. After administration of epinephrine, profound shock or vasomotor collapse should be treated with intravenous fluids, and other appropriate drugs. Oxygen should be given by mask. Intravenous antihistamine, theophylline or corticosteroids may be used if necessary after adequate epinephrine and circulatory support have been given. Emergency resuscitation measures and personnel trained in their use should be available immediately in the event of a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction not responsive to the above measures (Ref. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 77 (2): 271-273, 1986). Rarely are all of the above measures necessary; the tourniquet and epinephrine usually produce prompt responses. However, the physician should be prepared in advance for all contingencies. Promptness in beginning emergency treatment measures is of utmost importance.  3. Adverse Event Reporting  Report all adverse events to Jubilant HollisterStier LLC Customer Technical Services Department at 1 (800) 992-1120. A voluntary adverse event reporting system for health professionals is available through the FDA MEDWATCH program. Preprinted forms (FDA Form 3500) are available from the FDA by calling 1 (800) FDA-1088. Completed forms should be mailed to MEDWATCH, 5600 Fisher Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787 or Fax to: 1 (800) FDA-0178.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNINGS

  WARNINGS

  This product is intended for use only by licensed medical personnel experienced in administering allergenic extracts and trained to provide immediate emergency treatment in the event of a life-threatening reaction. Allergenic extracts may potentially elicit a severe life threatening systemic reaction, rarely resulting in death.  7    Therefore, emergency measures and personnel trained in their use must be available immediately in the event of such a reaction. Patients should be instructed to recognize adverse reaction symptoms and cautioned to contact the physician's office if symptoms occur. Patients on non-selective beta blockers may be more reactive to allergens given for testing or treatment and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions. This product should never be injected intravenously. Refer also to the   WARNINGS  ,   PRECAUTIONS  , and   ADVERSE REACTIONS   Sections for further discussion.
