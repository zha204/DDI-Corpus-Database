  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described below are from Study 1, a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 533 patients (median age 63 years; 61% men; 57% White, 35% Asian, 1% Black) with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer received LONSURF as a single agent at a dose of 35 mg/m  2  /dose administered twice daily on Days 1 through 5 and Days 8 through 12 of each 28-day cycle. The mean duration of LONSURF therapy was 12.7 weeks.



 The most common adverse drug reactions or laboratory abnormalities (all Grades and greater than or equal to 10% in incidence) in patients treated with LONSURF at a rate that exceeds the rate in patients receiving placebo were anemia, neutropenia, asthenia/fatigue, nausea, thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and pyrexia.



 In Study 1, 3.6% of patients discontinued LONSURF for an adverse event and 13.7% of patients required a dose reduction. The most common adverse reactions leading to dose reduction were neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and diarrhea.

      In Study 1, infections occurred more frequently in LONSURF-treated patients (27%) compared to those receiving placebo (15%). The most commonly reported infections which occurred more frequently in LONSURF-treated patients were nasopharyngitis (4% versus 2%), and urinary tract infections (4% versus 2%).
 

 In Study 1, pulmonary emboli occurred more frequently in LONSURF-treatment patients (2%) compared to no patients on placebo.



 Additional Clinical Experience



 Interstitial lung disease was reported in fifteen (0.2%) patients, three of which were fatal, among approximately 7,000 patients exposed to LONSURF in clinical studies and clinical practice settings in Asia.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Severe Myelosuppression: Obtain complete blood counts prior to and on Day 15 of each cycle. Reduce dose and/or hold LONSURF as clinically indicated. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Fetal harm can occur. Advise women of potential risk to a fetus. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Severe Myelosuppression



  In Study 1, LONSURF caused severe and life-threatening myelosuppression (Grade 3-4) consisting of anemia (18%), neutropenia (38%), thrombocytopenia (5%) and febrile neutropenia (3.8%). One patient (0.2%) died due to neutropenic infection. In Study 1, 9.4% of LONSURF-treated patients received granulocyte-colony stimulating factors.



 Obtain complete blood counts prior to and on Day 15 of each cycle of LONSURF and more frequently as clinically indicated. Withhold LONSURF for febrile neutropenia, Grade 4 neutropenia, or platelets less than 50,000/mm  3  . Upon recovery resume LONSURF at a reduced dose. [  see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  



    5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, LONSURF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Trifluridine/tipiracil caused embryo-fetal lethality and embryo-fetal toxicity in pregnant rats when orally administered during gestation at dose levels resulting in exposures lower than those achieved at the recommended dose of 35 mg/m  2  twice daily.



 Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LONSURF. [  see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.1  )]
