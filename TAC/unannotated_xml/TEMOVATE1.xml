  In a controlled trial with TEMOVATE  (r)  Gel, the only reported adverse reaction that was considered to be drug related was a report of burning sensation (1.8% of treated patients).



 In larger controlled clinical trials with other clobetasol propionate formulations, the most frequently reported adverse reactions have included burning, stinging, irritation, pruritus, erythema, folliculitis, cracking and fissuring of the skin, numbness of fingers, skin atrophy, and telangiectasia (all less than 2%).



 Cushing syndrome has been reported in infants and adults as a result of prolonged use of topical clobetasol propionate formulations.



 The following additional local adverse reactions are reported infrequently with topical corti-costeroids, but may occur more frequently with super-high potency corticosteroids such as TEMOVATE  (r)  Gel. These reactions are listed in approximate decreasing order of occurrence: dryness, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, irritation, striae, and miliaria.
