  It is frequently difficult to distinguish between an adverse reaction to SULFAMYLON Cream and the effect of a severe burn. A single case of bone marrow depression and a single case of acute attack of porphyria have been reported following therapy with SULFAMYLON Cream. Fatal hemolytic anemia with disseminated intravascular coagulation, presumably related to a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, has been reported following therapy with SULFAMYLON Cream.



   Dermatologic:  The most frequently reported reaction was pain on application or a burning sensation. Rare occurrences are excoriation of new skin and bleeding of skin.



   Allergic:  Rash itching, facial edema, swelling, hive, blisters, erythema, and eosinophilia.



   Respiratory:  Tachypnea or hyperventilation, decrease in arterial pCO2.



   Metabolic:  Acidosis, increase in serum chloride.Accidental ingestion of SULFAMYLON Cream has been reported to cause diarrhea.
