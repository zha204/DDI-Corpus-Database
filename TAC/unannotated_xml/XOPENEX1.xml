  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older  



 Adverse reaction information concerning XOPENEX HFA in adults and adolescents is derived from two 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled trials in 748 adult and adolescent patients with asthma that compared XOPENEX HFA, a marketed albuterol HFA inhaler, and an HFA-134a placebo inhaler.  Table 1  lists the incidence of all adverse reactions (whether considered by the investigator to be related or unrelated to drug) from these trials that occurred at a rate of 2% or greater in the group treated with XOPENEX HFA and more frequently than in the HFA-134a placebo inhaler group.

  * This table includes all adverse reactions (whether considered by the investigator to be related or unrelated to drug) from these trials that occurred at a rate of 2% or greater in the group treated with XOPENEX HFA and more frequently than in the HFA-134a placebo inhaler group.

           Adverse reactions reported by less than 2% and at least 2 or more of the adolescent and adult patients receiving XOPENEX HFA and by a greater proportion than receiving HFA-134a placebo inhaler include cyst, flu syndrome, viral infection, constipation, gastroenteritis, myalgia, hypertension, epistaxis, lung disorder, acne, herpes simplex, conjunctivitis, ear pain, dysmenorrhea, hematuria, and vaginal moniliasis. There were no significant laboratory abnormalities observed in these studies.
 

     Pediatric Patients 4 to 11 Years of Age  



 Adverse reaction information concerning XOPENEX HFA in children is derived from a 4-week, randomized, double-blind trial of XOPENEX HFA, a marketed albuterol HFA inhaler, and an HFA-134a placebo inhaler in 150 children aged 4 to 11 years with asthma.  Table 2  lists the adverse reactions reported for XOPENEX HFA in children at a rate of 2% or greater and more frequently than for placebo.

  * This table includes all adverse reactions (whether considered by the investigator to be related or unrelated to drug) from the trial that occurred at a rate of 2% or greater in the group treated with XOPENEX HFA and more frequently than in the HFA-134a placebo inhaler group.

           The incidence of systemic beta-adrenergic adverse reactions (e.g., tremor, nervousness) was low and comparable across all treatment groups, including placebo.
 

   6.2 Post-marketing Experience

  In addition to the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been observed in post-approval use of levalbuterol inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, their frequency of reporting, or their likely beta-mediated mechanism: angioedema, anaphylaxis, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, extrasystoles), asthma, chest pain, cough increased, dysphonia, dyspnea, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), metabolic acidosis, nausea, nervousness, rash, tachycardia, tremor, urticaria.



 In addition, XOPENEX HFA, like other sympathomimetic agents, can cause adverse reactions such as hypertension, angina, vertigo, central nervous system stimulation, sleeplessness, headache, and drying or irritation of the oropharynx.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Life-threatening paradoxical bronchospasm may occur. Discontinue XOPENEX HFA immediately and treat with alternative therapy. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Need for more doses of XOPENEX HFA than usual may be a sign of deterioration of asthma and requires reevaluation of treatment. (  5.2  ) 
 *  XOPENEX HFA is not a substitute for corticosteroids. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Cardiovascular effects may occur. Consider discontinuation of XOPENEX HFA if these effects occur. Use with caution in patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Excessive use may be fatal. Do not exceed recommended dose. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Discontinue XOPENEX HFA immediately. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Hypokalemia and changes in blood glucose may occur. (  5.7  ,  5.8  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Paradoxical Bronchospasm



  XOPENEX HFA can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, XOPENEX HFA should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm, when associated with inhaled formulations, frequently occurs with the first use of a new canister.



    5.2 Deterioration of Asthma



  Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If the patient needs more doses of XOPENEX HFA than usual, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for anti-inflammatory treatment, e.g., corticosteroids.



    5.3 Use of Anti-Inflammatory Agents



  The use of a beta-adrenergic agonist alone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients. Early consideration should be given to adding anti-inflammatory agents, e.g., corticosteroids, to the therapeutic regimen.



    5.4 Cardiovascular Effects



  XOPENEX HFA, like other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients, as measured by heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of XOPENEX HFA at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T-wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, XOPENEX HFA, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.



    5.5 Do Not Exceed Recommended Dose



  Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs in patients with asthma. The exact cause of death is unknown, but cardiac arrest following an unexpected development of a severe acute asthmatic crisis and subsequent hypoxia is suspected.



    5.6 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of racemic albuterol, as demonstrated by rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema. The potential for hypersensitivity must be considered in the clinical evaluation of patients who experience immediate hypersensitivity reactions while receiving XOPENEX HFA.



    5.7 Coexisting Conditions



  XOPENEX HFA, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias; in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Clinically significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been seen in individual patients and could be expected to occur in some patients after the use of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator.



 Large doses of intravenous racemic albuterol have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.



    5.8 Hypokalemia



  As with other beta-adrenergic agonist medications, XOPENEX HFA may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.
