      Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis, which may end fatally.
 

 Cases of diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported as adverse reactions in patients treated with oral and parenteral formulations of clindamycin and rarely with topical clindamycin (see  WARNINGS  ). Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal disturbances, as well as gram-negative folliculitis, have also been reported in association with the use of topical formulation of clindamycin.
