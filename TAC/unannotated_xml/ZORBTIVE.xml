      Adverse events that occurred in 1% to less than 10% of study participants receiving Zorbtive(r) in the placebo-controlled clinical efficacy trial are listed below by body system. The list of adverse events has been compiled regardless of casual relationship to Zorbtive(r).
 

   Body as a Whole, General:    edema, periorbital edema



   Gastrointestinal System:    melena, rectal hemorrhage, mouth disorder, steatorrhea



   Musculoskeletal System:    arthritis, arthropathy, bursitis, cramps



   Resistance Mechanism Disorders:    fungal infection



   Application Site Disorders:    reaction pain, inflammation at injection sites



   Central and Peripheral Nervous System:    parasthesia, phantom pain, visual field defect



   Respiratory System:    bronchospasm, dyspnea, pharyngitis, respiratory disorder, respiratory infection



   Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders:  purpura, prothrombin decrease



   Skin and Appendages:  skin disorder, increased sweating, alopecia, bullous eruption

   Vascular Extracardiac Disorders:    vasodilatation



 The safety profile of patients receiving Zorbtive(r) with glutamine was similar to the safety profile of patients receiving Zorbtive(r) without glutamine. During the baseline period, 88% of patients receiving Zorbtive(r) with glutamine, 88% of patients receiving Zorbtive(r) without glutamine, and 78% of patients receiving Zorbtive(r) placebo with glutamine reported baseline signs and symptoms (BSS). During the treatment period, 100% of patients receiving Zorbtive(r) with and without glutamine reported at least one adverse event (AE), whereas 89% of patients receiving Zorbtive(r) placebo with glutamine reported at least one AE. During the follow-up period, 81% of patients receiving Zorbtive(r) with glutamine, 80% of patients receiving Zorbtive(r) without glutamine and 78% of patients receiving Zorbtive(r) placebo with glutamine experienced at least one AE. Comparison of the number of serious adverse events (SAEs) before and during treatment demonstrates that this subject population experiences numerous BSSs and AEs due to their underlying conditions and parenteral nutrition complications. Four subjects (25%) receiving Zorbtive(r) without glutamine and one subject (11%) receiving Zorbtive(r) placebo with glutamine experienced at least one SAE during the treatment period (Zorbtive(r) without glutamine:  chest pain, purpura, fungal infection, pharyngitis; Zorbtive(r) placebo with glutamine: hemorrhoids). None of the subjects receiving Zorbtive(r) with glutamine experienced SAEs during the treatment period. During the follow-up period, 3 subjects (19%) receiving Zorbtive(r) with glutamine, 5 subjects (33%) receiving Zorbtive(r) without glutamine and 3 subjects (33%) receiving Zorbtive(r) placebo with glutamine experienced at least one SAE. There were no deaths in this study.
