  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to vaccine use and for approximating rates of those events.



 In a randomized, controlled, multicenter study conducted in the US and Puerto Rico (Study M5I02; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01346293), 3372 children, 4 to 6 years of age, who had received 4 doses of DAPTACEL and/or Pentacel vaccine(s) received Quadracel, or DAPTACEL + IPOL (Poliovirus Vaccine Inactivated) vaccines administered concomitantly but at separate sites. Subjects also received Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live (MMR) (Merck &amp; Co., Inc.) and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live (Varicella vaccine) (Merck &amp; Co., Inc.) administered concomitantly at separate sites. Safety was evaluated in 2733 subjects who received Quadracel and 621 subjects who received DAPTACEL + IPOL vaccines.



 Among these subjects, 51.5% were male, 48.5% were female, 75.7% were Caucasian, 8.6% were Black, 7.9% were Hispanic, 0.9% were Asian, and 7.8% were of other racial/ethnic groups. The mean age for both groups was 4.4 years and the ratio of male to female subjects and ethnicity were balanced between both groups.



 Solicited injection site reactions and systemic reactions were collected daily for 7 days following vaccination, via diary cards. Participants were monitored for unsolicited adverse events for 28 days and serious adverse events (SAEs) for 6 months after vaccination.



     Solicited Adverse Reactions  



 The incidence and severity of solicited injection site and systemic adverse reactions that occurred within 7 days after vaccination in each study group are shown in Table 1.

              Serious Adverse Events  
 

 In Study M5I02, within 28 days following vaccination with Quadracel, or DAPTACEL + IPOL vaccines, and concomitant MMR and varicella vaccines, 0.1% of subjects (3/2733) in the Quadracel group experienced a serious adverse event. During the same time period, 0.2% subjects (1/621) in the DAPTACEL + IPOL group experienced a SAE. Within the 6-month follow-up period after vaccination, SAEs were reported in 0.8% of subjects (21/2733) who received Quadracel and 0.5% of subjects (3/621) who received DAPTACEL + IPOL vaccines, none of which were assessed as related to vaccination.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse events have been spontaneously reported, during the post-marketing use of Quadracel outside the US, in infants and children from 2 months through 6 years of age. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. This list includes adverse events based on one or more of the following factors: severity, frequency of reporting, or strength of evidence for a causal relationship to Quadracel.



   Immune system disorders  



 *     Anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity and allergic reactions (such as rash, urticaria, dyspnea) 
      Psychiatric disorders  
 

 *     Screaming 
      Nervous system disorders  
 

 *     Somnolence, convulsion, febrile convulsion, HHE, hypotonia 
      Cardiac disorders  
 

 *     Cyanosis 
      Vascular disorders  
 

 *     Pallor 
      General disorders and administration site conditions  
 

 *     Listlessness 
 *     Injection site reactions (including inflammation, mass, sterile abscess, and edema) 
 *     Large injection site reactions (&gt;50 mm), including limb swelling which may extend from the injection site beyond one or both joints 
      Infections and Infestations  
 

 Injection site cellulitis, injection site abscess

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  *  -  fever &gt;=40.5 degrees C (&gt;=105 degrees F), hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (HHE) or persistent, inconsolable crying lasting &gt;=3 hours within 48 hours after a previous pertussis-containing vaccine. (  5.2  ) 
 *  -  seizures within 3 days after a previous pertussis-containing vaccine. (  5.2  ) 
   Carefully consider benefits and risks before administering Quadracel to persons with a history of: 
 *  If Guillain-Barre syndrome occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the decision to give any tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, including Quadracel, should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Management of Acute Allergic Reactions



  Epinephrine hydrochloride solution (1:1,000) and other appropriate agents and equipment must be available for immediate use in case an anaphylactic or acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs.



    5.2 Adverse Reactions Following Prior Pertussis Vaccination



  If any of the following events have occurred within the specified period after administration of a pertussis vaccine, the decision to administer Quadracel should be based on careful consideration of benefits and risks.



 *  Temperature of &gt;=40.5 degrees C (&gt;=105 degrees F) within 48 hours, not attributable to another identifiable cause. 
 *  Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode [HHE]) within 48 hours. 
 *  Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting &gt;=3 hours within 48 hours. 
 *  Seizures with or without fever within 3 days. 
       5.3 Guillain-Barre Syndrome
 

  If Guillain-Barre syndrome occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the decision to give any tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, including Quadracel, should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks.



    5.4 Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness



  Vaccination with Quadracel may not protect all individuals.



    5.5 Altered Immunocompetence



  If Quadracel is administered to immunocompromised persons, including persons receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be obtained. [See   Drug Interactions (7.2)    .]
