    <Section name="adverse reactions" id="S1">    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (&gt;4%) are local skin reactions (erythema, edema, erosion/ulceration, exudate, scabbing/crusting), headache, application site pain, application site irritation, application site pruritus, fatigue, influenza-like illness, and nausea. (  6.1  ,  6.2    )  



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience: Actinic Keratosis

  The data described below reflect exposure to ZYCLARA Cream or vehicle in 479 subjects enrolled in two double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials. Subjects applied up to two packets of ZYCLARA Cream or vehicle daily to the skin of the affected area (either entire face or balding scalp) for two 2-week treatment cycles separated by a 2-week no treatment period.

          Local skin reactions were recorded as adverse reactions only if they extended beyond the treatment area, if they required any medical intervention, or they resulted in patient discontinuation from the study. The incidence and severity of selected local skin reactions are shown in Table 2.

         Local skin reactions were recorded as adverse reactions only if they extended beyond the treatment area, if they required any medical intervention, or they resulted in patient discontinuation from the study. The incidence and severity of selected local skin reactions are shown in Table 4.

         The frequency and severity of local skin reactions were similar in both genders, with the following exceptions: a) flaking/scaling occurred in 40% of men and in 26% of women and b) scabbing/crusting occurred in 34% of men and in 18% of women.
 

 In the clinical trials, 32% (126/400) of subjects who used ZYCLARA Cream and 2% (4/202) of subjects who used vehicle cream discontinued treatment temporarily (required rest periods) due to adverse local skin reactions, and 1% (3/400) of subjects who used ZYCLARA Cream discontinued treatment permanently due to local skin/application site reactions.



 Other adverse reactions reported in subjects treated with ZYCLARA Cream include: rash, back pain, application site rash, application site cellulitis, application site excoriation, application site bleeding, scrotal pain, scrotal erythema, scrotal ulcer, scrotal edema, sinusitis, nausea, pyrexia, and influenza-like symptoms.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of imiquimod. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   Body as a Whole:  angioedema

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Intense local inflammatory reactions can occur (e.g., skin weeping, erosion). Dosing interruption may be required. (  2  ,  5.1  ,  6  ) 
 *    Severe local inflammatory reactions of the female external genitalia can lead to severe vulvar swelling. Severe vulvar swelling can lead to urinary retention; dosing should be interrupted or discontinued. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Flu-like systemic signs and symptoms including fatigue, nausea, fever, myalgias, arthralgias, and chills can occur. Dosing interruption may be required. (  2.1  ,  2.2  ,  5.2  ,  6  ) 
 *    Avoid concomitant use of ZYCLARA Cream and any other imiquimod cream because of increased risk for adverse reactions. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Local Skin Reactions



  Intense local skin reactions including skin weeping or erosion can occur after a few applications of ZYCLARA Cream and may require an interruption of dosing [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  ZYCLARA Cream has the potential to exacerbate inflammatory conditions of the skin, including chronic graft versus host disease.



 Severe local inflammatory reactions of the female external genitalia can lead to severe vulvar swelling. Severe vulvar swelling can lead to urinary retention. Dosing should be interrupted or discontinued for severe vulvar swelling.



 Administration of ZYCLARA Cream is not recommended until the skin is healed from any previous drug or surgical treatment.



    5.2 Systemic Reactions



  Flu-like signs and symptoms may accompany, or even precede, local skin reactions and may include fatigue, nausea, fever, myalgias, arthralgias, malaise and chills. An interruption of dosing and an assessment of the patient should be considered [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  



 Lymphadenopathy occurred in 2% of subjects with actinic keratosis treated with ZYCLARA Cream, 3.75% and in 3% of subjects treated with ZYCLARA Cream, 2.5% [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  This reaction resolved in all subjects by 4 weeks after completion of treatment.



    5.3 Ultraviolet Light Exposure Risks



  Exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided or minimized during use of ZYCLARA Cream. Patients should be warned to use protective clothing (e.g., a hat) when using ZYCLARA Cream. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use ZYCLARA Cream until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure, e.g., due to their occupation, and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise caution when using ZYCLARA Cream.



 In an animal photo-carcinogenicity study, imiquimod cream shortened the time to skin tumor formation [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  . The enhancement of ultraviolet carcinogenicity is not necessarily dependent on phototoxic mechanisms. Therefore, patients should minimize or avoid natural or artificial sunlight exposure.



    5.4 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Imiquimod Use



  Concomitant use of ZYCLARA Cream and any other imiquimod products, in the same treatment area, should be avoided since they contain the same active ingredient (imiquimod) and may increase the risk for and severity of local skin reactions.



 The safety of concomitant use of ZYCLARA Cream and any other imiquimod products has not been established and should be avoided since they contain the same active ingredient (imiquimod) and may increase the risk for and severity of systemic reactions.



    5.5 Immune Cell Activation in Autoimmune Disease



  ZYCLARA Cream should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing autoimmune conditions because imiquimod activates immune cells [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  .
