   EXCERPT:    *  The most common adverse reactions (incidence of &gt;= 10%) are muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia, weight loss, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgias, vomiting, and ageusia. 
      To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech, Inc. at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  
 

 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 ERIVEDGE capsule was administered as monotherapy at doses &gt;= 150 mg orally daily in four open-label, uncontrolled, dose-ranging or fixed single dose clinical trials enrolling a total of 138 patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The median age of these patients was 61 years (range 21 to 101), 100% were White (including Hispanics), and 64% were male. The median duration of treatment was approximately 10 months (305 days; range 0.7 to 36 months); 111 patients received ERIVEDGE for 6 months or longer.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 10%) were muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia, weight loss, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgias, vomiting, and ageusia (  Table 1  ).

    WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY  

    ERIVEDGE can cause embryo-fetal death or severe birth defects when administered to a pregnant woman. ERIVEDGE is embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic in animals. Teratogenic effects included severe midline defects, missing digits, and other irreversible malformations.   



   Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to initiating ERIVEDGE therapy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after ERIVEDGE therapy. Advise males of the potential risk of ERIVEDGE exposure through semen and to use condoms with a pregnant partner or a female partner of reproductive potential. Advise pregnant women of the potential risks to a fetus. [See     Warnings and Precautions (5.1  ,   5.3)  ,   Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,   8.3)    ].

   EXCERPT:    *  Blood donation: Advise patients not to donate blood or blood products while receiving ERIVEDGE and for 7 months after the final dose of ERIVEDGE. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Semen donation: Advise males not to donate semen during and for 3 months after therapy (  5.3  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action, ERIVEDGE can cause embryo-fetal death or severe birth defects when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, vismodegib was embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic at maternal exposures lower than the human exposures at the recommended dose of 150 mg/day.



 Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to initiating ERIVEDGE therapy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy with ERIVEDGE and for 7 months after the final dose. Advise male patients to use condoms, even after a vasectomy, to avoid potential drug exposure in pregnant partners and female partners of reproductive potential during therapy and for 3 months after the final dose of ERIVEDGE. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [see   Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)     and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)    ].



    5.2 Blood Donation



  Advise patients not to donate blood or blood products while receiving ERIVEDGE and for 7 months after the final dose of ERIVEDGE.



    5.3 Semen Donation



  Vismodegib is present in semen. It is not known if the amount of vismodegib in semen can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise male patients not to donate semen during and for 3 months after the final dose of ERIVEDGE [see   Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)    ] .
