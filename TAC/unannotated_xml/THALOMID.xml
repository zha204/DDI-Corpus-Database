  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Most patients taking thalidomide can be expected to experience adverse reactions.



   Teratogenicity:  



 The most serious toxicity associated with thalidomide is its documented human teratogenicity. The risk of severe birth defects, primarily phocomelia or death to the fetus, is extremely high during the critical period of pregnancy. The critical period is estimated, depending on the source of information, to range from 35 to 50 days after the last menstrual period. The risk of other potentially severe birth defects outside this critical period is unknown, but may be significant. Based on present knowledge, thalidomide must not be used at any time during pregnancy.



 Because thalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug, males receiving thalidomide must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.



   Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism:  



 An increased risk of venous thromboembolism (such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), ischemic heart disease (including myocardial infarction), and stroke have been reported in patients with multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide [  See  Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism (5.3)    ].



   Peripheral Neuropathy:  



 Peripheral Neuropathy is a very common, potentially severe, adverse reaction of treatment with thalidomide that may result in irreversible damage.  Peripheral neuropathy generally occurs following chronic use over a period of months. However, reports following relatively short-term use also exist. Incidence of neuropathy events leading to discontinuation, dose reduction or interruption increases with cumulative dose and duration of therapy.  Symptoms may occur some time after thalidomide treatment has been stopped and may resolve slowly or not at all.



 Somnolence, dizziness, and rash are the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of thalidomide. Adverse event profiles from clinical trials are summarized in the sections that follow.



   Adverse Reactions in Multiple Myeloma Controlled Clinical Trials  



 The safety analyses were conducted in two controlled clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2).  The safety analysis in Study 1 was conducted on 204 patients who received treatment. Table 1 lists the most common adverse drug reactions (&gt;= 10%). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were fatigue, hypocalcemia, edema, constipation, sensory neuropathy, dyspnea, muscle weakness, leukopenia, neutropenia, rash/desquamation, confusion, anorexia, nausea, anxiety/agitation , tremor, fever, weight loss, thrombosis/embolism, neuropathy-motor, weight gain, dizziness, and dry skin .



 Twenty-three percent of patients (47/204) discontinued due to adverse reactions; 30% (31/102) from the THALOMID/dexamethasone arm and 16% (16/102) from the dexamethasone alone arm.

      The safety analysis in Study 2 was conducted on 466 patients who received treatment. Table 2 lists the most common adverse drug reactions (&gt;= 10%) that were observed.  Table 3  lists the most common Grade 3/4 adverse drug reactions (occurring at &gt; 2%) that were observed. The adverse reactions most often reported by patients treated with THALOMID/dexamethasone were constipation, peripheral edema, tremor, asthenia, dizziness and fatigue. Adverse reactions with a frequency at least 2-fold higher in the THALOMID/dexamethasone group than in the placebo/dexamethasone group include constipation, tremor, deep vein thrombosis and peripheral sensory neuropathy.
 

 Twenty-six percent of patients (121/466) discontinued due to adverse events; 37% (86/234) from the THALOMID/dexamethasone arm and 15% (35/232) from the placebo/dexamethasone arm.

        Other Adverse Events Observed in ENL Patients  
 

 THALOMID in doses up to 400 mg/day has been administered investigationally in the United States over a 19-year period in 1465 patients with ENL. The published literature describes the treatment of an additional 1678 patients. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of the individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary/terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table. Due to the fact that these data were collected from uncontrolled studies, the incidence rate cannot be determined. No causal relationship between THALOMID and these events can be conclusively determined at this time.

    BOXED WARNING: 

    WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY AND VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM  



   EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY  



   If thalidomide is taken during pregnancy, it can cause severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death. Thalidomide should never be used by females who are pregnant or who could become pregnant while taking the drug. Even a single dose [1 capsule (regardless of strength)] taken by a pregnant woman during her pregnancy can cause severe birth defects.  



   Because of this toxicity and in an effort to make the chance of embryo-fetal exposure to THALOMID  (r)   (thalidomide) as negligible as possible, THALOMID  (r)   (thalidomide) is approved for marketing only through a special restricted distribution program: THALOMID REMSTM program, approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This program was formerly known as the "System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety (  S.T.E.P.S.    (r)   program)".  



   You can get the information about THALOMID and the THALOMID REMSTM program on the Internet at www.celgeneriskmanagement.com or by calling the manufacturer's toll-free number 1-888-423-5436.  



   VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM   



   The use of THALOMID  (r)   (thalidomide) in multiple myeloma results in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.  This risk increases significantly when thalidomide is used in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents including dexamethasone. In one controlled trial, the rate of venous thromboembolism was 22.5% in patients receiving thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone compared to 4.9% in patients receiving dexamethasone alone (p = 0.002). Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Instruct patients to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Consider thromboprophylaxis based on an assessment of individual patients' underlying risk factors.

   EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  



 *  If thalidomide is taken during pregnancy, it can cause severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death. Thalidomide should never be used by females who are pregnant or who could be pregnant while taking the drug. Even a single dose [1 capsule (regardless of strength)] taken by a pregnant woman during her pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. 
 *  Pregnancy must be excluded before start of treatment. Prevent pregnancy thereafter by the use of two reliable methods of contraception. (5.1) 
      THALOMID  (r)   (thalidomide) is only available through a restricted distribution program, the THALOMID REMSTM program (formerly known as the System for Thalomid Education and Prescribing Safety (  S.T.E.P.S.  (r)    ) program) (  5.2  ).  
 

   VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM  



 *  Significant increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with multiple myeloma receiving THALOMID(r) (thalidomide) with dexamethasone (5.3). 
</Section>
    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Ischemic heart disease (including myocardial infarction) and stroke have been observed in patients treated with THALOMID in combination with dexamethasone. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Drowsiness and Somnolence: Instruct patients to avoid situations where drowsiness may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause drowsiness. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Peripheral Neuropathy: Examine patients at monthly intervals for the first 3 months of thalidomide therapy and periodically thereafter for signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Consider electrophysiological testing, consisting of measurement of sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes at baseline and thereafter every 6 months in an effort to detect asymptomatic neuropathy. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension: Advise patients to sit upright for a few minutes prior to standing up from a recumbent position. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Neutropenia: Patients may require dose interruption and/or dose reduction. (  5.7  ) 
 *  Increased HIV Viral Load: Measure viral load after the first and third months of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. (  5.8  ) 
 *  Bradycardia: Monitor patients for bradycardia and possible syncope. Dose reduction or discontinuation may be required. (  5.9  ) 
 *  Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis: Do not resume THALOMID following discontinuation for these reactions. (  5.10  ) 
 *  Seizures: Monitor patients with a history of seizures or at risk for the development of seizures closely for clinical changes that could precipitate acute seizure activity. (  5.11  ) 
 *  Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Monitor patients at risk (e.g., those with high tumor burden prior to treatment) and take appropriate precautions. (  5.12  ) 
 *  Hypersensitivity: Monitor patients for potential hypersensitivity to the drug and its components. (  5.14  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Thalidomide is a powerful human teratogen that induces a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects, even after a single dose. Mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40% of infants. When there is no satisfactory alternative treatment, females of reproductive potential may be treated with thalidomide provided adequate precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy. THALOMID  (r)  (thalidomide) is only available through the THALOMID REMSTM program (formerly known as the " S.T.E.P.S.  (r)    program"), [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .



 Oral ingestion is the only type of maternal thalidomide exposure known to result in drug-associated birth defects. There are no specific data available regarding the reproductive risks of cutaneous absorption or inhalation of thalidomide; however, females of reproductive potential should avoid contact with THALOMID  (r)  (thalidomide) Capsules.  THALOMID Capsules should be stored in blister packs until ingestion. If there is contact with non-intact thalidomide capsules or the powder contents, the exposed area should be washed with soap and water.



 If healthcare providers or other care givers are exposed to body fluids from patients receiving THALOMID (thalidomide) the exposed area should be washed with soap and water.  Appropriate precautions should be utilized, such as wearing gloves to prevent the potential cutaneous exposure to THALOMID.



   Females of Reproductive Potential    Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks before beginning THALOMID therapy, during therapy, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy.
 

 Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with THALOMID, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of THALOMID therapy.



 Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing THALOMID therapy and then weekly during the first month, then monthly thereafter in women with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in women with irregular menstrual cycles [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  .



   Males    Thalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking THALOMID and for up to 28 days after discontinuing THALOMID, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy.   Male patients taking THALOMID must not donate sperm [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  .
 

   Blood Donation    Patients must not donate blood during treatment with THALOMID and for 1 month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to THALOMID.
 

    5.2 THALOMID REMSTM Program



  Because of the embryo-fetal risk [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  , THALOMID is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), the THALOMID REMSTM  program (formerly known as the " S.T.E.P.S.  (r)    " program).



 Required components of the THALOMID REMSTM  program include the following:



 *  Prescribers must be certified with the THALOMID REMSTM program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements. 
 *  Patients must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with the REMS requirements. In particular, female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ] and males must comply with contraception requirements [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ] . 
 *  Pharmacies must be certified with the THALOMID REMSTM program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive THALOMID and comply with REMS requirements. 
    Further information about the THALOMID REMSTM  program is available at www.celgeneriskmanagement.com or by telephone at 1-888-423-5436.
 

     5.3 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism  



   The use of THALOMID in patients with MM results in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This risk increases significantly when thalidomide is used in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents including dexamethasone. In one controlled trial, the rate of venous thromboembolism was 22.5% in patients receiving thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone compared to 4.9% in patients receiving dexamethasone alone (p = 0.002).  



  Ischemic heart disease (11.1%), including myocardial infarction (1.3%), and stroke (cerebrovascular accident, 2.6%) have also occurred in patients with previously untreated MM treated with THALOMID and dexamethasone compared to placebo and dexamethasone (4.7%, 1.7%, and 0.9%, respectively) in one clinical trial [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .  



  Consider thromboprophylaxis based on an assessment of individual patients' underlying risk factors. Patients and physicians should be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling [see  Boxed Warning  ]  . Agents that also may increase the risk of thromboembolism should be used with caution in patients receiving THALOMID [see  Drug Interactions (7.7)  ]  .  



    5.4 Drowsiness and Somnolence



  Thalidomide frequently causes drowsiness and somnolence. Patients should be instructed to avoid situations where drowsiness may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause drowsiness without adequate medical advice [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].   Advise patients as to the possible impairment of mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating other complex or dangerous machinery. Dose reductions may be required.



    5.5 Peripheral Neuropathy



  Thalidomide is known to cause nerve damage that may be permanent. Peripheral neuropathy is a common (&gt;=10%) and potentially severe adverse reaction of treatment with thalidomide that may be irreversible. Peripheral neuropathy generally occurs following chronic use over a period of months; however, peripheral neuropathy following relatively short-term use has been reported. The correlation with cumulative dose is unclear. Symptoms may occur some time after thalidomide treatment has been stopped and may resolve slowly or not at all.



 Few reports of neuropathy have arisen in the treatment of ENL despite long-term thalidomide treatment. However, the inability clinically to differentiate thalidomide neuropathy from the neuropathy often seen in Hansen's disease makes it difficult to determine accurately the incidence of thalidomide-related neuropathy in ENL patients treated with thalidomide.



 Patients should be examined at monthly intervals for the first 3 months of thalidomide therapy to enable the clinician to detect early signs of neuropathy, which include numbness, tingling or pain in the hands and feet. Patients should be evaluated periodically thereafter during treatment. Patients should be regularly counseled, questioned, and evaluated for signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Consideration should be given to electrophysiological testing, consisting of measurement of sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes at baseline and thereafter every 6 months in an effort to detect asymptomatic neuropathy. If symptoms of drug-induced neuropathy develop, thalidomide should be discontinued immediately to limit further damage, if clinically appropriate. Usually, treatment with thalidomide should only be reinitiated if the neuropathy returns to baseline status.



 Medications known to be associated with neuropathy should be used with caution in patients receiving thalidomide [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  .



    5.6 Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension



  Patients should also be advised that thalidomide may cause dizziness and orthostatic hypotension and that, therefore, they should sit upright for a few minutes prior to standing up from a recumbent position.



    5.7 Neutropenia



  Decreased white blood cell counts, including neutropenia, have been reported in association with the clinical use of thalidomide. Treatment should not be initiated with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &lt;750/mm  3  . White blood cell count and differential should be monitored on an ongoing basis, especially in patients who may be more prone to neutropenia, such as patients who are HIV-seropositive. If ANC decreases to below 750/mm  3  while on treatment, the patient's medication regimen should be re-evaluated and, if the neutropenia persists, consideration should be given to withholding thalidomide if clinically appropriate.



    5.8 Increased HIV Viral Load



  In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of thalidomide in an HIV-seropositive patient population, plasma HIV RNA levels were found to increase (median change = 0.42 log10copies HIV RNA/mL, p = 0.04 compared to placebo). A similar trend was observed in a second, unpublished study conducted in patients who were HIV-seropositive. The clinical significance of this increase is unknown. Both studies were conducted prior to availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Until the clinical significance of this finding is further understood, in HIV-seropositive patients, viral load should be measured after the first and third months of treatment and every 3 months thereafter.



    5.9 Bradycardia



  Bradycardia in association with thalidomide use has been reported. Cases of bradycardia have been reported, some required medical interventions. The clinical significance and underlying etiology of the bradycardia noted in some thalidomide-treated patients are presently unknown.  Monitor patients for bradycardia and syncope. Dose reduction or discontinuation may be required.



 Medications known to decrease heart rate should be used with caution in patients receiving thalidomide [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .



    5.10 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis



  Serious dermatologic reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which may be fatal, have been reported. THALOMID should be discontinued if a skin rash occurs and only resumed following appropriate clinical evaluation. If the rash is exfoliative, purpuric, or bullous or if Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis is suspected, use of THALOMID should not be resumed.



    5.11 Seizures



  Although not reported from pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, seizures, including grand mal convulsions, have been reported during post-approval use of THALOMID in clinical practice. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. Most patients had disorders that may have predisposed them to seizure activity, and it is not currently known whether thalidomide has any epileptogenic influence. During therapy with thalidomide, patients with a history of seizures or with other risk factors for the development of seizures should be monitored closely for clinical changes that could precipitate acute seizure activity.



    5.12 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



  Monitor patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome (e.g., patients with high tumor burden prior to treatment) and take appropriate precautions.



    5.13 Contraceptive Risks



  Some contraceptive methods may pose a higher risk of adverse effects or may be medically contraindicated in some patients treated with THALOMID. Because some patients may develop sudden, severe neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, use of an intrauterine device (IUD) or implantable contraception in these patients may carry an increased risk for infection or bleeding either at insertion, removal or during use. Treatment with THALOMID, the presence of an underlying malignancy, and/or use of an estrogen-containing contraceptive can each increase the risk of thromboembolism. It is not known if these risks of thromboembolism are additive. However, they should be taken into consideration when choosing contraceptive methods.



    5.14 Hypersensitivity



  Hypersensitivity to THALOMID has been reported. Signs and symptoms have included the occurrence of erythematous macular rash, possibly associated with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, and if severe, may necessitate interruption of therapy. If the reaction recurs when dosing is resumed, THALOMID should be discontinued.
