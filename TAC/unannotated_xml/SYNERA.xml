  EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions (&gt;10%) were localized and included erythema, blanching, and edema. (  6  )



 



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Galen US  Inc. at 866-949-9277 and or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

    6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 Three different formulations were studied during clinical development of SYNERA: Developmental A (n=138), Developmental B (n=30), and the SYNERA final formulation (n=1281). The developmental patch formulations each contained the same amount of the active drug (70 mg each of lidocaine and tetracaine) as the final patch formulation, but varying amounts of excipients, principally polyvinyl alcohol and water. Data obtained from studies utilizing the developmental patches have been included in the overall evaluation of SYNERA safety (calculation of adverse event incidence).



   Most common adverse events in clinical trialsLocalized Reactions  During or immediately after treatment with SYNERA, the skin at the site of treatment may develop erythema, blanching, edema, or abnormal sensation. In clinical studies involving 1449 SYNERA-treated subjects, the most common local reactions were erythema (71%), blanching (12%) and edema (12%). These reactions were generally mild, resolving spontaneously soon after patch removal. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events.



 Other application site reactions of various types (contact dermatitis, rash, skin discoloration) occurred in less than 4% of SYNERA-treated patients during clinical trials. Of these adverse events, 75% were mild, resolving spontaneously soon after patch removal.



 Application site-related adverse events that occurred in 1% or less of SYNERA-treated subjects included rash,  pruritus, pain, contact dermatitis, infection, skin discoloration, allergic reaction, blister, paresthesia, urticaria, and vesiculobullous rash.



   Allergic Reactions  Allergic or anaphylactoid reactions can occur with the active or inactive components of SYNERA. They may be characterized by urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and shock. Allergic reactions to the patch should be managed by conventional means.



   Systemic (Dose-Related) Reactions  Systemic adverse reactions that occurred in 1% or less of SYNERA-treated subjects included dizziness, headache, nausea, somnolence, and vomiting. Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine and tetracaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide and ester local anesthetic agents, including CNS excitation and/or depression (light-headedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Signs of CNS toxicity may start at plasma concentrations of lidocaine as low as 1000 ng/mL. The plasma concentrations at which tetracaine toxicity may occur are less well characterized; however, systemic toxicity with tetracaine is thought to occur with much lower plasma concentrations compared with lidocaine. The toxicity of co-administered local anesthetics is thought to be at least additive. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5   WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    Application of SYNERA for longer duration than recommended or the simultaneous or sequential application of multiple SYNERA patches could result in serious adverse effects. (  5.1  ,  10  )   Store and dispose of SYNERA out of the reach of children and pets due to the large amount of lidocaine and tetracaine (at least 90% of the initial amount) present in used patches. (  5.2  ) Use with caution in patients who may be more sensitive to the systemic effects of lidocaine and tetracaine, including the acutely ill or those with severe hepatic disease or pseudocholinesterase deficiency. (  5.7  ) Allergic or anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine or tetracaine can occur. (  5.6  ) Avoid contact with the eyes. (  5.3  ) Not recommended for use on mucous membranes or on areas with a compromised skin barrier. (  5.3  ) The SYNERA patch must be removed before a patient undergoes magnetic resonance imaging. (  5.4  )
 

 



     5.1 Overexposure



  Application of a SYNERA patch for longer duration than recommended, or the simultaneous or sequential application of multiple SYNERA patches, could result in sufficient absorption of lidocaine and tetracaine to result in serious adverse effects [ see  Overdosage (10)    ].



      5.2 Storage and Disposal



  Used SYNERA patches contain a large amount of lidocaine and tetracaine (at least 90% of the initial amount). The potential exists for a child or pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or ingesting a new or used SYNERA patch. It is important for patients to store and dispose of SYNERA out of the reach of children and pets.



      5.3 Avoidance of Exposure to Eyes and Mucous Membranes



   Contact of SYNERA with the eyes should be avoided based on the findings of severe eye irritation with the use of similar products in animals. Also, the loss of protective reflexes may predispose to corneal irritation and potential abrasion. If eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns.



  SYNERA is not recommended for use on mucous membranes or on areas with a compromised skin barrier because these uses have not been studied. Application to broken or inflamed skin may result in toxic blood concentrations of lidocaine and tetracaine from increased absorption.



      5.4 Magnetic Resonance Imaging



  The integrated heating component contains iron powder; therefore, the SYNERA patch must be removed before a patient undergoes magnetic resonance imaging.



      5.5 Methemoglobinemia



   Several local anesthetics, including tetracaine, have been associated with methemoglobinemia. The risk of methemoglobinemia is greatest for patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, and infants under the age of twelve months who are receiving treatment with methemoglobin-inducing agents.



  Very young patients or patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies have an increased risk of methemoglobinemia.



  Patients taking concomitant drugs associated with drug-induced methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine are also at greater risk for developing methemoglobinemia.



  There have been no reports of methemoglobinemia with SYNERA. However, providers are cautioned to carefully apply SYNERA to ensure that the areas of application and duration of application are consistent with those recommended for the intended population.



      5.6 Allergic Reactions



  Allergic or anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine, tetracaine, or other components of SYNERA can occur. They are characterized by urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and shock. If an allergic reaction occurs, it should be managed by conventional means.



      5.7 Special Patient Populations



   SYNERA should be used with caution in patients who may be more sensitive to the systemic effects of lidocaine and tetracaine particularly the acutely ill or debilitated.



  Patients with severe hepatic disease or pseudocholinesterase deficiency, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations of lidocaine and tetracaine.



      5.8 Vaccinations



  Lidocaine has been shown to inhibit viral and bacterial growth. The effect of SYNERA on intradermal injections of live vaccines has not been determined.
