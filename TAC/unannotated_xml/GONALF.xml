  The safety of Gonal-f  (r)  RFF was examined in two clinical studies [one ovulation induction study (n=83) and one study in ART (n=237)].



 Adverse events (without regard to causality assessment) occurring in at least 2.0% of patients in Study 22240 (ovulation induction) are listed in Table 4.

        Headache and abdomen enlargement occurred in more than 10% of patients and abdominal pain occurred in more than 20% of patients.
 

 The following medical events have been reported subsequent to pregnancies resulting from Gonadotropins in controlled clinical studies:



 *  Spontaneous Abortion 
 *  Ectopic Pregnancy 
 *  Premature Labor 
 *  Postpartum Fever 
 *  Congenital Abnormalities 
    There are no indications that use of gonadotropins during ART is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations.
 

 The following adverse reactions have been previously reported during Gonal-f  (r)  RFF therapy:



 *  Pulmonary and vascular complications (see   WARNINGS   ), 
 *  Adnexal torsion (as a complication of ovarian enlargement), 
 *  Mild to moderate ovarian enlargement, 
 *  Hemoperitoneum 
    There have been infrequent reports of ovarian neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for ovulation induction; however, a causal relationship has not been established.
 

   Postmarketing Experience

  In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been reported during postmarketing use of Gonal-f  (r)  RFF. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, the frequency or a causal relationship to Gonal-f  (r)  RFF can not be reliably determined.
