  Adverse reactions reported in &gt;=5% of patients were: throat irritation, oral pruritus, ear pruritus, oral paraesthesia, mouth edema, and tongue pruritus.



    EXCERPT:    *  Adverse reactions reported in &gt;=5% of patients were: throat irritation, oral pruritus, ear pruritus, oral paraesthesia, mouth edema, and tongue pruritus. (  6  ) 
      To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  
 

 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice  .  



 In 4 placebo-controlled clinical trials, 1057 subjects 18 years of age and older with short ragweed pollen-induced rhinitis, with or without conjunctivitis, received at least one dose of RAGWITEK, of whom 327 (31%) completed at least 12 weeks of therapy. Of the subjects treated with RAGWITEK, 52% were male, 25% had mild asthma, and 82% were sensitized to other allergens in addition to ragweed pollen. The subject population was 83% White, 12% African American, and 2% Asian. Subject demographics in placebo-treated subjects were similar to the active group. The pooled analysis includes safety data from two 28-day safety studies and safety data from the first 28 days of two 52-week safety and efficacy studies. Adverse reactions reported in &gt;=1% of subjects in the 28-day pooled analysis treated with RAGWITEK are shown in Table 1.



 The most common adverse reactions reported in subjects treated with RAGWITEK were throat irritation (16.6% vs 3.3% placebo), oral pruritus (10.9% vs 2.0%), ear pruritus (10.4% vs 1.1%), and oral paraesthesia (10.0% vs 4.0%). The percentage of subjects who discontinued from the clinical trials because of an adverse reaction while exposed to RAGWITEK or placebo was 4.4% and 0.8%, respectively. The most common adverse reactions that led to study discontinuation in subjects who were exposed to RAGWITEK were mouth edema, swollen tongue, and dysphagia.



 One subject (1/1057; 0.1%) who received RAGWITEK experienced a treatment-related severe systemic allergic reaction that led to discontinuation of RAGWITEK. The subject had local reactions starting on Day 1 of treatment with RAGWITEK. On Day 6 symptoms progressed and included swelling of the throat, dyspnea, nausea, and lightheadedness. The subject fully recovered after treatment with epinephrine (self-administered), antihistamines, and oral corticosteroids.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions and instruct them to seek immediate medical care and discontinue therapy should any of these occur. (  5.1  ) 
 *  In case of oral inflammation or wounds, stop treatment with RAGWITEK to allow complete healing of the oral cavity. (  5.7  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Severe Allergic Reactions



  RAGWITEK can cause systemic allergic reactions including anaphylaxis which may be life-threatening. In addition, RAGWITEK can cause severe local reactions, including laryngopharyngeal swelling, which can compromise breathing and be life-threatening. Educate patients to recognize the signs and symptoms of these allergic reactions and instruct them to seek immediate medical care and discontinue therapy should any of these occur. Allergic reactions may require treatment with epinephrine. [See  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  .]  



 Administer the initial dose of RAGWITEK in a healthcare setting under the supervision of a physician with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases and prepared to manage a life-threatening systemic or local allergic reaction. Observe patients in the office for at least 30 minutes following the initial dose of RAGWITEK.



    5.2 Epinephrine



  Prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine to patients receiving RAGWITEK. Instruct patients to recognize the signs and symptoms of a severe allergic reaction and in the proper use of emergency auto-injectable epinephrine. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical care upon use of auto-injectable epinephrine and to stop treatment with RAGWITEK. [See     Patient Counseling Information (17)  .]  



 See the epinephrine package insert for complete information.



 RAGWITEK may not be suitable for patients with certain medical conditions that may reduce the ability to survive a serious allergic reaction or increase the risk of adverse reactions after epinephrine administration. Examples of these medical conditions include but are not limited to: markedly compromised lung function (either chronic or acute), unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, significant arrhythmia, and uncontrolled hypertension.



 RAGWITEK may not be suitable for patients who are taking medications that can potentiate or inhibit the effect of epinephrine. These medications include:



    Betaeta-adrenergic blockers:  Patients taking beta-adrenergic blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat serious systemic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Specifically, beta-adrenergic blockers antagonize the cardiostimulating and bronchodilating effects of epinephrine.



    Alpha-adrenergic blockers, ergot alkaloids:  Patients taking alpha-adrenergic blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat serious systemic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Specifically, alpha-adrenergic blockers antagonize the vasoconstricting and hypertensive effects of epinephrine. Similarly, ergot alkaloids may reverse the pressor effects of epinephrine.



    Tricyclic antidepressants, levothyroxine sodium, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and certain antihistamines:  The adverse effects of epinephrine may be potentiated in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants, levothyroxine sodium, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and the antihistamines chlorpheniramine, and diphenhydramine.



    Cardiac glycosides, diuretics:  Patients who receive epinephrine while taking cardiac glycosides or diuretics should be observed carefully for the development of cardiac arrhythmias.



    5.3 Upper Airway Compromise



  RAGWITEK can cause local reactions in the mouth or throat that could compromise the upper airway [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Consider discontinuation of RAGWITEK in patients who experience persistent and escalating adverse reactions in the mouth or throat.



    5.4 Eosinophilic Esophagitis



  Eosinophilic esophagitis has been reported in association with sublingual tablet immunotherapy [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  . Discontinue RAGWITEK and consider a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis in patients who experience severe or persistent gastro-esophageal symptoms including dysphagia or chest pain.



    5.5 Asthma



  Subjects with asthma who participated in clinical trials had asthma of a severity that required, at most, a daily low dose of an inhaled corticosteroid. RAGWITEK has not been studied in subjects with moderate or severe asthma.



 Withhold immunotherapy with RAGWITEK if the patient is experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation. Reevaluate patients who have recurrent asthma exacerbations and consider discontinuation of RAGWITEK.



    5.6 Concomitant Allergen Immunotherapy



  RAGWITEK has not been studied in subjects who are receiving concomitant allergen immunotherapy. Concomitant dosing with other allergen immunotherapy may increase the likelihood of local or systemic adverse reactions to either subcutaneous or sublingual allergen immunotherapy.



    5.7 Oral Inflammation



  Stop treatment with RAGWITEK to allow complete healing of the oral cavity in patients with oral inflammation (e.g., oral lichen planus, mouth ulcers, or thrush) or oral wounds, such as those following oral surgery or dental extraction.
