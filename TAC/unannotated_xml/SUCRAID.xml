  Adverse experiences with Sucraid in clinical trials were generally minor and were frequently associated with the underlying disease.



 In clinical studies of up to 54 months duration, physicians treated a total of 52 patients with Sucraid. The adverse experiences and respective number of patients reporting each event (in parenthesis) were as follows: abdominal pain (4), vomiting (3), nausea (2), diarrhea (2), constipation (2), insomnia (1) headache (1) nervousness (1) and dehydration (1).



 Note: diarrhea and abdominal pain can be a part of the clinical presentation of the  genetically determined sucrase deficiency,  which is part of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID).



 One asthmatic child experienced a serious hypersensitivity reaction (wheezing) probably related to sacrosidase (see  Warnings  ). The event resulted in withdrawal of the patient from the trial but resolved with no sequelae.
