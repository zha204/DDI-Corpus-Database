  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Travelers' Diarrhea    



 The safety of XIFAXAN 200 mg taken three times a day was evaluated in patients with travelers' diarrhea consisting of 320 patients in two placebo-controlled clinical trials with 95% of patients receiving three or four days of treatment with XIFAXAN. The population studied had a mean age of 31.3 (18-79) years of which approximately 3% were &gt;= 65 years old, 53% were male and 84% were White, 11% were Hispanic.



 Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.4% of patients.  The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were taste loss, dysentery, weight decrease, anorexia, nausea and nasal passage irritation.



 All adverse reactions for XIFAXAN 200 mg three times daily that occurred at a frequency &gt;= 2% in the two placebo-controlled trials combined are provided in Table 1. (These include adverse reactions that may be attributable to the underlying disease.)

 The data described below reflect exposure to XIFAXAN 550 mg in 348 patients, including 265 exposed for 6 months and 202 exposed for more than a year (mean exposure was 364 days).  The safety of XIFAXAN 550 mg taken two times a day for reducing the risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence in adult patients was evaluated in a 6-month placebo-controlled clinical trial (n = 140) and in a long term follow-up study (n = 280).  The population studied had a mean age of 56.26 (range: 21-82) years; approximately 20% of the patients were &gt;= 65 years old, 61% were male, 86% were White, and 4% were Black.  Ninety-one percent of patients in the trial were taking lactulose concomitantly. All adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence &gt;= 5% and at a higher incidence in XIFAXAN 550 mg-treated subjects than in the placebo group in the 6-month trial are provided in Table 2. (These include adverse events that may be attributable to the underlying disease).

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of XIFAXAN.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made.   These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting or causal connection to XIFAXAN. 



     Infections and Infestations     



 Cases of -associated colitis have been reported .  C. difficile    [see Warnings and Precautions ( )]  5.2    



     General    



 Hypersensitivity reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, rash, angioneurotic edema (swelling of face and tongue and difficulty swallowing), urticaria, flushing, pruritus and anaphylaxis have been reported.  These events occurred as early as within 15 minutes of drug administration.

       5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Travelers' Diarrhea Not Caused by : XIFAXAN was not effective in diarrhea complicated by fever and/or blood in the stool or diarrhea due to pathogens other than . If diarrhea symptoms get worse or persist for more than 24-48 hours, discontinue XIFAXAN and consider alternative antibiotics ( ) E. coli  E. coli   5.1   
 *  -Associated Diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs after therapy or does not improve or worsens during therapy ( ) Clostridium difficile   5.2   
 *  Hepatic Impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment ( , )  5.4    8.7   
 *    Concomitant P-glycoprotein inhibitor:  Caution should be exercised when concomitant use of rifaximin and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor is needed ( , ).  5.5    7.2     
    
 

   5.1 Travelers' Diarrhea Not Caused by Escherichia coli



  XIFAXAN was not found to be effective in patients with diarrhea complicated by fever and/or blood in the stool or diarrhea due to pathogens other than . Escherichia coli  



 Discontinue XIFAXAN if diarrhea symptoms get worse or persist more than 24-48 hours and alternative antibiotic therapy should be considered.



 XIFAXAN is not effective in cases of travelers' diarrhea due to . The effectiveness of XIFAXAN in travelers' diarrhea caused by spp. and spp. has not been proven. XIFAXAN should not be used in patients where , spp., or spp. may be suspected as causative pathogens. Campylobacter jejuni   Shigella   Salmonella   Campylobacter jejuni   Shigella   Salmonella  



    5.2 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea



  -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including XIFAXAN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.  Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon which may lead to overgrowth of . Clostridium difficile   C. difficile  



 produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD.  Hypertoxin producing strains of cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy.  CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use.  Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. C. difficile   C. difficile  



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against may need to be discontinued.  Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. C. difficile   C. difficile  



    5.3 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria



  Prescribing XIFAXAN for travelers' diarrhea in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.



    5.4 Severe (Child-Pugh C) Hepatic Impairment



  There is increased systemic exposure in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Animal toxicity studies did not achieve systemic exposures that were seen in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The clinical trials were limited to patients with MELD scores &lt;25. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering XIFAXAN to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) . [see Use in Specific Populations ( ) and Clinical Studies ( )]  8.7    14.2    



    5.5 Concomitant use with P-glycoprotein Inhibitors



   Concomitant administration of drugs that are P-glycoprotein inhibitors with rifaximin can substantially increase the systemic exposure to rifaximin.  Caution should be exercised when concomitant use of rifaximin and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor such as cyclosporine is needed.  In patients with hepatic impairment, a potential additive effect of reduced metabolism and concomitant P-glycoprotein inhibitors may further increase the systemic exposure to rifaximin .
