  The adverse reactions below, most of which are anticholinergic in nature, have been reported and within each category are listed in order of decreasing severity.



   Cardiovascular:  Tachycardia.



   Digestive:  Paralytic ileus, constipation, vomiting, nausea, dry mouth.



 If dry mouth is so severe that there is difficulty in swallowing or speaking, or loss of appetite and weight, reduce dosage, or discontinue the drug temporarily.



 Slight reduction in dosage may control nausea and still give sufficient relief of symptoms. Vomiting may be controlled by temporary discontinuation, followed by resumption at a lower dosage.

   Urogenital:  Urinary retention, dysuria.



   Metabolic/Immune or Skin:  Occasionally, an allergic reaction, e.g., skin rash, develops. If this cannot be controlled by dosage reduction, the medication should be discontinued.



   Other:  Heat stroke, hyperthermia, fever.
