  Rapid injection may cause the patient to complain of tingling sensations, a calcium taste, a sense of oppression or "heat wave".



 Injections of calcium chloride are accompanied by peripheral vasodilatation as well as a local "burning" sensation and there may be a moderate fall in blood pressure.



 Should perivascular infiltration occur, I.V. administration at that site should be discontinued at once. Local infiltration of the affected area with 1% procaine hydrochloride, to which hyaluronidase may be added, will often reduce venospasm and dilute the calcium remaining in the tissues locally. Local application of heat may also be helpful.
