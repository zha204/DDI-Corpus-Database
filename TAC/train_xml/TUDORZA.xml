  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     3-Month and 6-Month Trials  



 TUDORZA PRESSAIR was studied in two 3-month (Trials B and C) and one 6-month (Trial D) placebo-controlled trials in patients with COPD. In these trials, 636 patients were treated with TUDORZA PRESSAIR at the recommended dose of 400 mcg twice daily.



 The population had a mean age of 64 years (ranging from 40 to 89 years), with 58% males, 94% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) percent predicted of 48%. Patients with unstable cardiac disease, narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials.



 Table 1shows all adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of greater than or equal to 1% in the TUDORZA PRESSAIR group in the two 3-month and one 6-month placebo-controlled trials where the rates in the TUDORZA PRESSAIR group exceeded placebo.

         In addition, among the adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials with an incidence of less than 1% were diabetes mellitus, dry mouth, 1st degree AV block, osteoarthritis, cardiac failure, and cardio-respiratory arrest.
 

       Long-term Safety Trials    



 TUDORZA PRESSAIR was studied in three long term safety trials, two double blind and one open label, ranging from 40 to 52 weeks in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Two of these trials were extensions of the 3-month trials, and one was a dedicated long term safety trial. In these trials, 891 patients were treated with TUDORZA PRESSAIR at the recommended dose of 400 mcg twice daily. The demographic and baseline characteristics of the long term safety trials were similar to those of the placebo-controlled trials. The adverse events reported in the long term safety trials were similar to those occurring in the placebo-controlled trials of 3 to 6 months. No new safety findings were reported compared to the placebo controlled trials.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of drug TUDORZA PRESSAIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 In postmarketing experience with TUDORZA PRESSAIR, immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or itching have been reported.
</Section>
    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *    Not for acute use: Not for use as a rescue medication. (5.1) 
 *    Paradoxical bronchospasm: Discontinue TUDORZA PRESSAIR and consider other treatments if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs. (5.2) 
 *    Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. (5.3) 
 *    Worsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. (5.4) 
 *    Immediate hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue TUDORZA PRESSAIR at once and consider alternatives if immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis, occur. Use with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins. (5.5) 
    
   5.1 Not for Acute Use

  TUDORZA PRESSAIR is intended as a twice-daily maintenance treatment for COPD and is not indicated for the initial treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm (i.e., rescue therapy).



   5.2 Paradoxical Bronchospasm

  Inhaled medicines, including TUDORZA PRESSAIR, may cause paradoxical bronchospasm. If this occurs, treatment with TUDORZA PRESSAIR should be stopped and other treatments considered.



   5.3 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma

  TUDORZA PRESSAIR should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop.



   5.4 Worsening of Urinary Retention

  TUDORZA PRESSAIR should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop.



   5.5 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions

  Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or itching, have occurred after administration of TUDORZA PRESSAIR. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with TUDORZA PRESSAIR should be stopped at once and alternative treatments should be considered. Given the similar structural formula of atropine to aclidinium, patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine should be closely monitored for similar hypersensitivity reactions to TUDORZA PRESSAIR. In addition, TUDORZA PRESSAIR should be used with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins.
