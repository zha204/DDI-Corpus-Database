  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     Pool of 12 Placebo-Controlled Studies for FARXIGA 5 and 10 mg  

  The data in Table 1 is derived from 12 placebo-controlled studies ranging from 12 to 24 weeks. In 4 studies FARXIGA was used as monotherapy, and in 8 studies FARXIGA was used as add-on to background antidiabetic therapy or as combination therapy with metformin  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ].  



 These data reflect exposure of 2338 patients to FARXIGA with a mean exposure duration of 21 weeks. Patients received placebo (N=1393), FARXIGA 5 mg (N=1145), or FARXIGA 10 mg (N=1193) once daily. The mean age of the population was 55 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty percent (50%) of the population were male; 81% were White, 14% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 6 years, had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8.3%, and 21% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 92% of patients and moderately impaired in 8% of patients (mean eGFR 86 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ).



 Table 1 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of FARXIGA. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on FARXIGA than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either FARXIGA 5 mg or FARXIGA 10 mg.

              Pool of 13 Placebo-Controlled Studies for FARXIGA 10 mg  
   The safety and tolerability of FARXIGA 10 mg was also evaluated in a larger placebo-controlled study pool. This pool combined 13 placebo-controlled studies, including 3 monotherapy studies, 9 add-on to background antidiabetic therapy studies, and an initial combination with metformin study. Across these 13 studies, 2360 patients were treated once daily with FARXIGA 10 mg for a mean duration of exposure of 22 weeks. The mean age of the population was 59 years and 4% were older than 75 years. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the population were male; 84% were White, 9% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.2%, and 30% had established microvascular disease. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% of patients and moderately impaired in 11% of patients (mean eGFR 82 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ).



     Volume Depletion  

  FARXIGA causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to reductions in intravascular volume. Adverse reactions related to volume depletion (including reports of dehydration, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, or hypotension) are shown in Table 2 for the 12-study and 13-study, short-term, placebo-controlled pools  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .

                Impairment of Renal Function  
   Use of FARXIGA was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR (see Table 3). In patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function at baseline, serum creatinine and eGFR returned to baseline values at Week 24. Renal-related adverse reactions, including renal failure and blood creatinine increase, were more frequent in patients treated with FARXIGA (see Table 4). Elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function were more susceptible to these adverse reactions (see Table 4). Sustained decreases in eGFR were seen in patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ).

            The safety of FARXIGA was evaluated in a study of patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  )  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . In this study 13 patients experienced bone fractures for treatment durations up to 104 weeks. No fractures occurred in the placebo group, 5 occurred in the FARXIGA 5 mg group, and 8 occurred in the FARXIGA 10 mg group. Eight of these 13 fractures were in patients who had a baseline eGFR of 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m  2  . Eleven of the 13 fractures were reported within the first 52 weeks. There was no apparent pattern with respect to the anatomic site of fracture.
 

     Hypoglycemia  

  The frequency of hypoglycemia by study  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  is shown in Table 5. Hypoglycemia was more frequent when FARXIGA was added to sulfonylurea or insulin  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



 Table 5: Incidence of MajorMajor episodes of hypoglycemia were defined as symptomatic episodes requiring external (third party) assistance due to severe impairment in consciousness or behavior with a capillary or plasma glucose value &lt;54 mg/dL and prompt recovery after glucose or glucagon administration. and MinorMinor episodes of hypoglycemia were defined as either a symptomatic episode with a capillary or plasma glucose measurement &lt;63 mg/dL regardless of need for external assistance, or an asymptomatic capillary or plasma glucose measurement &lt;63 mg/dL that does not qualify as a major episode.

              Genital Mycotic Infections  
   Genital mycotic infections were more frequent with FARXIGA treatment. Genital mycotic infections were reported in 0.9% of patients on placebo, 5.7% on FARXIGA 5 mg, and 4.8% on FARXIGA 10 mg, in the 12-study placebo-controlled pool. Discontinuation from study due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with FARXIGA 10 mg. Infections were more frequently reported in females than in males (see Table 1). The most frequently reported genital mycotic infections were vulvovaginal mycotic infections in females and balanitis in males. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to have a genital mycotic infection during the study than those with no prior history (10.0%, 23.1%, and 25.0% versus 0.8%, 5.9%, and 5.0% on placebo, FARXIGA 5 mg, and FARXIGA 10 mg, respectively).



     Hypersensitivity Reactions  

  Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, urticaria, hypersensitivity) were reported with FARXIGA treatment. Across the clinical program, serious anaphylactic reactions and severe cutaneous adverse reactions and angioedema were reported in 0.2% of comparator-treated patients and 0.3% of FARXIGA-treated patients. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of FARXIGA; treat per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.



     Laboratory Tests  

    Increase in Hematocrit  

  In the pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies, increases from baseline in mean hematocrit values were observed in FARXIGA-treated patients starting at Week 1 and continuing up to Week 16, when the maximum mean difference from baseline was observed. At Week 24, the mean changes from baseline in hematocrit were -0.33% in the placebo group and 2.30% in the FARXIGA 10 mg group. By Week 24, hematocrit values &gt;55% were reported in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients and 1.3% of FARXIGA 10 mg-treated patients.



     Increase in Serum Inorganic Phosphorus  

  In the pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies, increases from baseline in mean serum phosphorus levels were reported at Week 24 in FARXIGA-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients (mean increase of 0.13 versus -0.04 mg/dL, respectively). Higher proportions of patients with marked laboratory abnormalities of hyperphosphatemia (&gt;=5.6 mg/dL for age 17-65 years or &gt;=5.1 mg/dL for age &gt;=66 years) were reported on FARXIGA at Week 24 (0.9% versus 1.7% for placebo and FARXIGA 10 mg, respectively).



     Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol  

  In the pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies, changes from baseline in mean lipid values were reported in FARXIGA-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. Mean percent changes from baseline at Week 24, were 0.0% versus 2.5% for total cholesterol and -1.0% versus 2.9% for LDL cholesterol, in the placebo and FARXIGA 10 mg groups, respectively.

    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S2">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Hypotension: Before initiating FARXIGA, assess volume status and correct hypovolemia in the elderly, in patients with renal impairment or low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy.  (5.1  ,  6.1)   
 *     Impairment in renal function: Monitor renal function during therapy.  (5.2)   
 *     Hypoglycemia: In patients taking insulin or an insulin secretagogue with FARXIGA, consider a lower dose of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.  (5.3)   
 *     Genital mycotic infections: Monitor and treat if indicated.  (5.4)   
 *     Increased LDL-C: Monitor and treat per standard of care.  (5.5)   
 *     Bladder Cancer: An imbalance in bladder cancers was observed in clinical trials. FARXIGA should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and should be used with caution in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer.  (5.6)   
 *     Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with FARXIGA or any other antidiabetic drug.  (5.7)   
    
 

   5.1 Hypotension



  FARXIGA causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension can occur after initiating FARXIGA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  particularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics. Before initiating FARXIGA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, volume status should be assessed and corrected. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy.



    5.2 Impairment in Renal Function



  FARXIGA increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function may be more susceptible to these changes. Adverse reactions related to renal function can occur after initiating FARXIGA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of FARXIGA and monitored periodically thereafter.



    5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues



  Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. FARXIGA can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used in combination with FARXIGA.



    5.4 Genital Mycotic Infections



  FARXIGA increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor and treat appropriately.



    5.5 Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)



  Increases in LDL-C occur with FARXIGA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor LDL-C and treat per standard of care after initiating FARXIGA.



    5.6 Bladder Cancer



  Across 22 clinical studies, newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer were reported in 10/6045 patients (0.17%) treated with FARXIGA and 1/3512 patient (0.03%) treated with placebo/comparator. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 4 cases with FARXIGA and no cases with placebo/comparator. Bladder cancer risk factors and hematuria (a potential indicator of pre-existing tumors) were balanced between treatment arms at baseline. There were too few cases to determine whether the emergence of these events is related to FARXIGA.



 There are insufficient data to determine whether FARXIGA has an effect on pre-existing bladder tumors. Consequently, FARXIGA should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer. In patients with prior history of bladder cancer, the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with FARXIGA should be considered.



    5.7 Macrovascular Outcomes



  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with FARXIGA or any other antidiabetic drug.
